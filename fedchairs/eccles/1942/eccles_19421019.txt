PRESIDENT FLEEKs

Thank you very much, Aims.

We very

much a p p r e c ia te your bein g here and t e l l i n g us what you had to say.
A few weeks ago in Washington I had a ta lk w ith the C hair­
man o f the Board o f Governors o f th e F ederal R eserve System.

He f i ­

n a lly agreed t o be h ere today i f I would not ask him t o say an yth in g.
He s a id :

M
I do n o t w ish t o make any s e t speech or be on the program ."

However, he i s here and 1 think I w i l l not do to o much v io le n c e to
my commitment w ith him o f a few weeks ago i f I ask him t o say a few
words t o you .

be q u ite a disappointm ent t o have someone unexpected th ru s t on your

I do n ot know th a t I can add very much t o what has been a l ­

I have f e l t that our tax program i s in ad equ ate.

I t seems t o

lo o k in g t o the fu tu re not le s s than 50% o f the c o s t o f the war

should be r a is e d c u r re n tly in t a x a tio n .

Taxation i s the most a n t i-

in f la t io n a r y method o f fin a n cin g the w ar, and i s the soundest method
o f fin a n cin g the w ar.

I t i s im portant where th ose ta x es come from .

They must come from sources th at w i l l c o n tr ib u te g r e a t ly to an in ­
f la t io n a r y s p i r a l .
The p e o p le o f la rg e income a re small and few .

The g re a t

consumer purchasing power w i l l come from th ose p e o p le w ith incomes o f
le s s than $ b ,0 0 0 .

I f a l l o f the income was taken away from th ose w ith

income above $5,000 i t would n ot be a drop in the buck et in co n n e ctio n
w ith the fin a n c in g o f the w ar.

Consumer goods are d im inish ing and are

goin g t o con tin u e t o dim inish r a p id ly .

So th ere i s no advantage to

be gained by the p eop le as a whole in having more money than they are
a b le t o spend in the purchase o f g ood s.

l e c t i n g enough ta x es t o pay f o r the war c u r r e n tly .

The B r it is h and

Canadians have succeeded in c o l l e c t i n g enough taxes t o pay f o r f u l l y
h a l f the c o s t o f the w ar.
c a n 't do lik e w is e .

There i s no reason why we, in the fu tu r e ,

What i s n ot fin a n ced in th a t manner must b e f i ­

nanced, so f a r as p o s s ib le , as we have heard to d a y , from o u ts id e o f
the banks.

I would f e e l t h a t n ot le s s than 25% should be fin a n ced o u t­

s id e o f the banks.

The Canadians and the B r it is h up t o date have f i - -

nanced o u ts id e o f the banks more than 25%.
The l a s t r e s o r t in con n ection w ith fin a n c in g i s fin a n c in g
by the banks.

I should not say that is the l a s t r e s o r t , because the

l a s t r e s o r t i s fin a n c in g by th e F ederal R eserve System.
