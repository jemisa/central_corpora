Mr. Frank A. Hecht, President,
Navy League of the United States,
The Mills Building,
Washington 6, D. C.
Dear Mr. Hecht:
Your l e t t e r of September 26 takes issue with remarks attributed
to me in the Washington Post regarding the bearing of expenditures f o r
national defense upon the present inflationary situation* I am sending
you a copy of my prepared statement, which was released to the press; the
complete statement w i l l make i t possible f o r you to judge my remarks in
their proper setting. I am somewhat surprised that your l e t t e r , which was
based on an incomplete press report of my speech, was given out f a r publication before you r^ad my complete statement.
You w i l l note that I discussed the basic causes of i n f l a t i o n
growing out of governmental policy of war finance. I pointed out that
i n f l a t i o n i s certain to result from war unless controls are maintained
until supply and demand are more nearly in balance. In discussing the
necessity of continued large expenditures by the Government, especially
f o r foreign aid, I indicated that i t cannot be denied or ignored that
they are ,fa heavy current burden upon our taxpayers or a strong i n f l a tionary force on cur economy, but so are our even larger military expenditures, which are considered by many as necessary f o r maintaining
peace."
Under the circumstances any large Government expenditures are
inflationary or in any event reduce the a b i l i t y of the Government to
f o l l o w an anti-inflationary policy without further increases in taxes.
With military expenditures comprising the largest single item in the
budget, i t must be recognized that they are one of the most important
factors that contribute to i n f l a t i o n . There are certainly many others.
What I endeavored to point out in my speech was that the public should be
f u l l y aware of the costs and risks involved in the various p o l i c i e s being
followed.
We are faced with a choice between unattractive alternatives*
We must decide how much we are going to spend preparing f o r the next war
or f o r other purposes that might be eliminated or deferred. At the same
time we need to determine how much we are going t o make available to maintain peace through provision of v i t a l food and needed productive f a c i l i t i e s
to the starving and destitute Western European democracies. I t should be
recognized that we cannot continue to spend as much as we have been f o r a l l of
these purposes, in the presence of other strong inflationary pressures in
the economy, without severe costs and risks. Either the f u l l harness of
wartime controls w i l l need to be reimposed, which at this stage i s impracticable, or serious i n f l a t i o n with a subsequent disastrous collapse i s
likely to result. We should endeavor to safeguard our economy from the consequences of any such development.
The purpose of my speech was primarily to point out to the State
bank supervisors the forces creating i n f l a t i o n and to suggest what they and

the banks might do to help reduce those forces or to safeguard their banks
against them. I f each of us in his own f i e l d should act accordingly the
dangers of i n f l a t i o n would be diminished.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed)

M. S. Ecclos.

Chairman*
