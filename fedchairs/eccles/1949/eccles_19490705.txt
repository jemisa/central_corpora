tome ne&spaper reports have erroneously inaic&ted that X disagreed
with the Federal Open Market Coj&nittee^ announcement last week of a policy
of greater f l e x i b i l i t y in open market transactions with a view to a further
easing of bank credit. I strongly favored the policy, as an appropriate
step in a time of credit contraction, because i t permits the automatic re-»
lease of aoout $800,000,000 of reserves on June 30 to take effect in the
money market without being nullified by open market sales from the System's
p o r t f o l i o , as far as practicable, the market will be free to determine prices
and yields without the intervention of the federal Open Market Committee.
Since fee h«ve had easy money conditions %ith relatively lofc rateb
a i l along in the money market i t should not be supposed that fatill easier
conditions with lower rates will correct or cure a deflationary trend, a l though they say encourage greater use of the existing money supply end put
the banks in a position mere they will have s t i l l less reason to restrict
credit. To the extent that the Reserve System becomes a reluctant seller
of i t s holdings of Government securities banks may be more disposed to ¡sake
productive loans t o private borrowers or at least avoid putting pressure on
good borrowers to pay o f f loans. Monetary policy cannot, of course, make
lenders lend or borrowers borrow; i t cannot correct maladjustment s within
the economic structure which have arisen from non-monetary causes. It cannot
by i t s e l f bring about the very necessary price uid other readjustments within
the economy.
The liquidity of the economy today i s unprecedented and the consuming public, investors, <*nd financing institutions of a l l kinds are in
stronger financial position than ever before, i t
clear, therefore, that
with the existence of this condition of underlying strength the only change
in monetary and credit policy that needs to take place i s in the emphasis
and direction of Federal Reserve actions towards relaxation rather than
restraint.
