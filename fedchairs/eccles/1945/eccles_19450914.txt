OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
Statement f o r the Press
For immediate release

September ll*, 19U5

Following i s a copy of a l e t t e r which the Board of Governors has sent
to Senator McCarran, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and a l s e
t o Representative Manasco, Chairman of the House Committee on Expenditures in the
Executive Departments, with regard t o reorganization l e g i s l a t i o n :
The Board has noted with approval the endorsement by the Comptroller
General and by the Director of the Budget of reorganization l e g i s l a t i o n
without exemption of any Government agency or department, excepting the
General Accounting O f f i c e .
The Board desires to c a l l the a t t e n t i o n of the Committee to the
enclosed excerpts from the Board f s Annual Report of 1938 emphasizing the
need f o r reorganization of the Federal banking agencies, i n view of the
confusions and c o n f l i c t s inherent i n the e x i s t i n g d i f f u s i o n of powers and
authority i n t h e Federal bank supervisory and regulatory agencies.
The Board has long fayored enactment of a reorganization measure
t h a t would give the President a f r e e hand, subject to Congressional approval, to i n i t i a t e necessary reorganizations i n the Executive Branch.
The Board had not previously requested and does not now wish exemption
from the operation of such a measure.
The Board, t h e r e f o r e , favors enactment of a reorganization b i l l
which does not include exemptions, except f o r t h e General Accounting
O f f i c e . Such a measure would make possible a reorganization of the
Federal banking agencies which the Board f e e l s i s urgently needed t o
meet the needs of the postwar world.
