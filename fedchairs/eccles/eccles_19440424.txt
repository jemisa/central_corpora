April Â¿4, 1944

STATEMENT OF MARRINER S. ECCLES, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, ON THE PROPOSAL OF THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS REPRESENTING THIRTY-FOUR NATIONS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL STABILIZATION FUND
International economic cooperation in the trying postwar period
is a matter of great significance for postwar prosperity. It is a matter
of no small consequence that agreement of technical experts representing
thirty-four nations on international collaboration has been achieved.
Federal Reserve technicians have participated in the discussions
from the beginning, and Federal Reserve authorities, in view of their responsibilities relative to credit conditions in this country, have a great
interest in the effect of any arrangements relating to currency stabilization.
It is understood that no governments are committed by the action
of the technicians. It now becomes necessary for the executive branch of
the Government to consider the proposal of the technical experts and to
determine Mi at course of action in this matter should be undertaken and
ultimately what program should be recommended to Congress.
