talking about the inflation problem means telling the atory of
a big Job that l

i
'
t being done m well me it ought to be, Between thie
morning and the olose of bueineee this afternoon, the Federal Government
spent about 500 itiJlion dollars* Hinety~two per cent of thie mas spent
for *ar purposes* today
spsnt sixteen times as mdi as the Canadians
spent* three and a half time* as much as the *ngUsh spent* Wo one really
knows hem «uch Sussts and Germany are spending* but it is a fair guess that
ws are spending as much as those two mighty imations cabined* although ws
have less than one«ha!>f of their combined population.
We are spending sonsy on a scale that shorn that we intend to
win this war* but I am sorry to say that we are raising that money in a
way that will hinder us rather than help us in winning it*
Fighting a modern war means that the oitiUan population must do
without* «e somstlmss talk as if it was the Government here in Washington
that was asking the people to do without* If ths Government had done a
better job df organising the economic eide of our war effort* the sacrificss we shaU have to make might have been a little smaller* But, basically*
these sacrifices wsre not decided on in Washington* the sacrifices the
American people are now beginning to make were imposed on them by decisions
made in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo* How big they will be and how long they will
have to last will be dscided not in Washington, but on the battlefields of
Xurope, Asia, and Africa*
In ths coming year the gross product of our economic system ~
everything turned out by our t^rm$ mines, and factories including services
will amount to some #175 billion, a figure considerably higher than ever
before in our national history* But out of this vast flow of goods ths
Government will take no less than #90 billion for war purposes* Fart of
what is left over will be needed for repairing and replacing our capital
equipment and for the irreducible minimum of non^miHtary governmental
functions* the goods and services remaining for sale to civilian consumers,
valued at prevailing prices, will amount to no more than #70 billion* That
is — the value of a U the goods that can be sold to our people* that is
all the money we ought to give the public to spend on these goods* If the
people spend more than that amount on these goods, their spsnding will not
bring them any more goods, hut only the same goods at higher prices* the
cost of living will continue to rise and we will be puahed faster and faster
along the road to Inflation, a road that we have already begun to travel*
It is a shocking fact that next year we propose to give the public,
not Just the #70 billion that they need to buy these goods at prevailing
prices, but very much more than this* After paying their taxes, the public
wiU have available to spend on these goods, not #10,000,000,000 mors than
these goods are worth, not #20,000,000,000 more than they are worth, but
#60,000,000,000 more than they are worth*

We can expect the public to save part of this vast sxeass of
purchasing power* If ws continue to encourage people to pay their debts,
to buy eavings bonds, and to save In other ways, we can expect them to
save about oae~half of this ami But the pressure of the other half, in
the absence of stronger measures to deal with the situation than now see*
to be contemplated, will drive prices up by at least one«*third of their
present level and probably by a good deal more than this*
It is no answer to say *but we have fixed prices* they cannot
rise farther because the Government has said so.* the Government can fix
prices but it cannot guarantee housewives that goods wiH continue to be
available for sale at the prices it has fixed* He are beginning to see
that this is so in the case of coffee* le see that it is so in the case
of meet and before many more weeks have passed, we will see that it is so
for many other things*
We are going a step further* We are rationing these scarce goods*
Ve are asking an effort to see that however small supplies may be, they are
fairly distributed* That is one way of dealing with the problem* the more
fundamental way of dealing with it, and a way more consistent with the
framework of our American institutions, i& to reduce thie vast excess of
purchasing power by a really adequate program of taxation and compulsory
saving*
Congress has done a magnificent job in enacting thefievenueAct
of 1%2* that Act takes us a long way in the ri^it direction* 1 am sorry
that I mat say, however, that it is just not on the ri#t scale to deal
with the gigantic problems of war finance that are confronting us* fo do
the financial job that needs to be done, the huge total of ft* 5 billion
in taxes snd compulsory saving provided by the Revenue Act of 1942 should
have been just about three times as big*
In what I have said so far, I have emphasized the fiscal aspects
of the inflation problem* there is another aspect — a monetary aspect*
In the current fiscal year, the treasury will hav to borrow about 160 billion*
Of that amount about #40 billion will have to be borrowed from the banks*
In the next fiscal year
beginning only eight months from now
the figures will be even bigger and the story about the part borrowed from the
banks will be even worse* ihen we sell these huge amounts of Government
securitlee to the banks, we increase their deposits* their deposits are
the checkbook money that our people will try to spend on our diminishing
volume of civilian goods and services* the volume of things the people can
buy Is getting smaller and smaller) the amount of money that they can spsmd
on those things is getting bigger and bigger. It does not make economic
sense*
Besides the explosive effect on prices of this increasing volume
of money, it involves the most serious dangers for the future soundness of
our banking structure* *hese deposits are coming into existence as a part

t process of war finance* but they wiH remain as a constant threat
economic stability and to our banking structure even alter peace comes,
Moreover* the preannea of these securities In the portfolios of our banks
Imposes upon the Eeserve system an unavoidable obligation to prevent a
fail in the prices of those securities and the resulting disaster to our
banking structure* this obligation seriously ititerferes with the exercise
of the instruments of credit policy which the Sj$%m might otherwise uae to
check a post-war inflationary situation* Hie powers with which the Reserve
System has at its disposal to deal idth this situation are entirely inadequate.
No central banking powers could be adequate to deal with this situation on
the scale m mhich it is now developing. Our only effective remedy is to
tax more and borrow less and to see that our borrowing represents the savings
of the people and not the result of bank credit creation,
this is the problem as I see it. It is not a small scale problem*
it has enormous dimensions. It is not a problem that will develop some time
in the remote ffcturej it is a problem that began to develop before we entered
the war and is spreading and growing worse as we sit here today,
Wiat can be done about itf I believe that our financial policies
are developing in the ri#it direction* but we are not moving in that direct
tioa fast enough. We have m
*
*
d
e and are continuing to make three major
mistakes in our financial policies, »e have leaned too heavily m voluntary
savings! we have not placed sufficient restrictions on mass growth of pusv
Rasing powerj end we have borrowed too heavily from the banks, Large*
scale borrowing from the banks ought to be a last resort whan a nation can
no longer tax and can no longer borrow from its people. Instead of that*
we have used it as our primary source of funds9 in a period i
f
e
e
n we are still
far from the limits of our taxable capacity and far from having ej&aueted
the public*s ability to save and to lend to the Government, Voluntary savings have their place in war finance, but it is not the place shich #e have
mistakenly assigned it, Our voluntary savings program has two great defects.
The savings that have been lent to the Government under this program are
not stable, Savings bonds can be converted into cash at no loss to the
holder and that cash can be added to the vast flood of cash that threaten*
to overwhelm us, This is a danger that we shaU have to face not'only during
the war but afterward* i
s
h
e
n the danger of inflation may be even sore serious
than at the peak of our war effort* In the second place* voluntary savings
under our present program are Just not big enough to do the Job, Voluntary
savings should be continued* but only as a supplement to an adequate program
of compulsory savings, Voluntary savings should be used as an outlet for the
funds of our citizens uhose economic circumstances* or nhosa patriotism makes
it possible for them to land the Government even mora than the share assigned
to them under a compulsory plan.
In the restrictions it places on mass purchasing power* the
Revenue Act Just enacted goes in the right direction but again it does not
go far enough. The 24 per cent rate placed on income subject to income t
a
r
n
under the Act (5 per cent Victory tax* 4 per cent normal tax* 13 per cent
initial surtax) is still not high enou$u The whole of the 24 per cent* or

the i&ole of any higher rate, ought to be collected at the source instead
of merely the 5 per cent that represent* the Victory tax*
ie need stronger measures along these lines* ¥h#y ou^ht to he
strong enough to make a *&®aificant reduction in the Government requirements
for funds to be supplied by the banks, perhaps strong enough to out those
requirements in half *
In the fisoal field, as in other fields, we have been guilty of
unjustified optiaisa. The policies now being pursued are leading us toward
disaster* It is my hope and belief that these policies can be changed before
it is too late*
