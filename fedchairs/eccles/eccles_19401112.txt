Statement of Mr* Marriner S. Secies, Chairman of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, at the Conference of federal Reserve
Officers, Service Procurement Officers, and Director of Small Business
Activities, held at the Federal Reserve Building, Washington, D. C#t
November 12 - 13, 1940.

Governor Draper and members of the Board, Mr. Kelson, and
representatives of the Reserve Banks, I believe this meeting will
turn out to be rather an important occasion.

I believe it will be

the beginning of a service and a relationship that will mean a great
deal to the Federal Reserve System as well as to the business, and
particularly the small business, of the country as a whole.
A meeting of this size indicates the extent of the Federal
Reserve System.

Large as this group is, there is not more than one

or two men present representing each bank or each branch of the System.
Few people realize the extent or the size, coverage, and facilities of
the Federal Reserve System*
The Board of Governors has felt for some time that the facil­
ities of the System, its trained personnel, its strategic location,
could be much more effectively used than has been the case for some
time past.
In early June the following letter was addressed to the
President of the United Statesr
"June 19, 1940
nAs a means for advancing the defense program effectively
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with the
cooperation of the officers and directors of the Federal Re­
serve Banks, wishes to offer you the facilities of the System.
The offer covers both operating plant and the services of the
System as a going organization*

"Included la the plant are the offices and equipment
of the twelve Federal Beserve Banks and their twenty-four
branches situated in thirty-six leading cities in various
part® of the country* These cities are so distributed that
they afford dose contact with every part of the whole area
of the country and its economic structure.
"As an illustration of the possible use the Advisory
Commission to the Cornell of national Defense sight desire
to make of Federal Reserve facilities» office space could
be provided in eaeh or some of the Federal Reserve Bank and
branch buildings throughout the com try for a representa­
tive or representatives of the Coismission* These represent­
atives could have personal contact over the territory served
the Bank or branch, and sight in many cases make it un­
necessary for industrialists and others within the district
to travel on to Washington.
"The System is connected by special telegraphic service
centered at the Board*s offices and already utilized daily
by the Ifnited States Treasury in the transfer of Government
fimds and otherwise*
"The System collects and compiles currently information
as to the productive and distributive activities of business
in all fields— agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construc­
tion, distribution, finance— and as to employment and prices.
This and other necessary information could be made available
to the Advisory Oowission to the Council of National Defense*
"In addition to the administrative and professional
staff which the System can make available to the defense pro­
gram, there Is also available the assistance of Members of
the Federal Advisory Council and the boards of directors of
the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and their branches*
"Each of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks has a board
of nine directors— three of these are bankers; six are busi­
ness and professional men whose private interests and expe­
rience lie in manufacturing, transportation, merchandising,
farming, publishing, education, and other important fields.
The directors of the branches are similarly representative,
not only of banking, but of commerce, agriculture and other
industrial pursuits— a total of two hundred and sixty*
"The Federal Reserve Banks are already acting, as they
have for years, as fiscal agents of the X
S
n
ited States Govern­
ment *
"During the last war the services performed by the Fed­
eral Reserve Banks in this capacity were, it is believed, of
the utmost importance in facilitating the fiscal business of
the Government.

*le hope that you will call these services and facili­
ties to the attention of the members of the Advisory Commiesion to the Council of National Defense and that yon and they
will ask the Reserve Systeea for any service it may perform
through its plant and organization,”
As a result of this letter being sent to the President and
being brought by him to the attention of the Comraission, there has been
worked out by the Defense Commission, at least in general outline, a
plan to take advantage of this offer.
The proposal seems to me to be an excellent thing for the
far and Kavy Departments, for the Defense Comission, for business,
particularly small business, and for the Reserve System.
It should prove of value to the War Department, because they
desire, as a matter of strategic importance, to have decentralized, so
far as possible, the productive facilities for national defense*

It

is also desirable at a time when bottlenecks are in prospect and when
capacities are being approached in isany lines, that the complete and
full utilization of the plant and facilities that can be furnished by
little business should be brought into play*
The Defense Commission naturally is desirous of getting the
defease program carried out as rapidly as possible and of avoiding
bottlenecks or the building of additional unnecessary facilities.
It is desirable likewise from the standpoint of the housing
of the labor supply to distribute, so far as possible, the defens®
business and avoid the shifting of labor throughout the country, to
avoid the unnecessary construction of housing*

Fro® tin® standpoint of mmll businaa^, a great many of them
during th® period of the depression have operated at considerable dis­
advantage» and if their facilities can be used and they can be put
upon a profitable basis*, it will be a sound economic development*
The Reserve System has for some time been looked upon large­
ly as a standby institution*

A» you know, its credit facilities and

aoae qf its officer personnel bare not been utilised to the fullest
extent possible*

$e are in Slopes that this progms will give us an

opportunity to u$e to a fuller extent the Reserve Bento and breach fa­
cilities end the officers of the Reserve Banka and their branches*

It

» organisations if such personnel ars made thor­

oughly ftsmiliar with the frogrsa that it is expected the Reserve %@tsnf
in conjunction with the Defense C&mi&uloa$ can carry out*

If that can

be done, it eeeas to me that- the Job is likely to be a dynamic rather
than a static one.
There is bo question that in a progrsa of tils sort change*
are numerous«

Many problems will arise.

We should expect this and not

Wa have asked for this opportunity through the President of

and to lot&artake the use of the facilities of the Systm *
isost unfortunate for the Syatm

It would be

if we should fall down anywhere along

the line»

I do not think that anything of that sort is likely to

happen*
I do want to impress upon you, however, the great need for
your putting forth your maximum effort in undertaking to facilitate
in every possible way the business that we will have to do as repre­
sentatives of the Defense Comission and the War and Navy Departments
on the one hand and of little business in our territory on the other.
