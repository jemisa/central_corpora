The proposed b i l l would extend f o r 3 years the existing temporary authority, under the Second War Powers Act, whereby Federal Reserve
Banks may purchase up to 5 b i l l i o n dollars of Government securities to
meet temporary deficiencies in Treasury balances with the Reserve Banks.
The b i l l would restore to a limited degree an authority which
the Federal Reserve System had from i t s inception in 1914 until the
Banking Act of 1935» A provision was inserted in that Act requiring all
purchases of Government securities by Federal Reserve Banks to be made
in the open market, which means purchased chiefly from dealers in Government bonds* Those who inserted this proviso were motivated by the mistaken theory that i t would help to prevent d e f i c i t financing. According
to the theory, Government borrowing should be subject to the if test of the
market.w The so-called "test" could only be applied to marketable securit i e s , and the test would be meaningless unless applied to them in an ent i r e l y regulated market« There could be no such market except at the risk
of chaotic conditions in the bond market and incalculable added costs to
the Government in managing the public debt.
Congress vested in the Federal Reserve authority to create reserves f o r the banking system primarily by purchases of Government securities in the open market* Purchases as well as sales of Government securities are made by the Open Market Committee, established by Congress f o r
that purpose. Policy governing these operations i s determined on the basis
of the broad needs of the economy at any given time. Through these operations the Government bond market has been kept relatively stable, notwithstanding the vast increase in the public debt as a result of the war, and
the Treasury has had an assured market f o r new as well as refunding issues
at interest rates satisfactory to the Government*
Nothing constructive would be accomplished by the proviso that
the Reserve System must purchase Government securities exclusively in the
open market. About a l l that such a ban means i s that in makiiig such
purchases a commission has to be paid to Government bond dealers. The
prohibition would not restrict the total amount of Government financing,
nor would i t a f f e c t the general level of interest rates, and that is the
only way in which the "test of the market'' could be manifested. Interest
rates on Government securities have been and w i l l continue to be determined
by the Open Market Committee in consultation with the Treasury. Finally,
i t i s unrealistic to presume, as this theory does, that i f Congress votes
f o r expenditures but does not vote f o r sufficient taxes to cover the expenditures, the money market should erect barriers to discourage the
practice*
The purpose f o r which the direct purchase authority has always
been used in the past and would be used in the future is simply one of
meeting temporary needs of the Treasury which, i f met in other ways, would
entail either needless additional costs in managing the public debt or
equally needless fluctuations in the securities and money markets f o r brief
periods. "What i s involved in the proposed b i l l i s not a question of monetary theory or policy, but simply a question of e f f i c i e n t , economical and
businesslike management of the public debt.

The direct purchase authority merely provides a line of available credit f o r use i f needed. Without i t , the Treasury would f e e l
obliged to carry much larger cash balances, which means that i t would have
to borrow more and thereby increase the amount and cost of the public debt*
In other words, having the authority, even though there may be no need to
use i t , enables the Treasury to carry smaller balances than would otherwise
be possible and thus reduces interest charges» For every b i l l i o n dollars
of Treasury balance that can be saved in this way, interest costs would be
reduced by at least b million dollars.
As the Committee knows, with a huge public debt, much of i t in
short maturities,, frequent, periodic refunding operations are necessary»
For example, more than 10 b i l l i o n dollars of Treasury b i l l s , certificates
and notes f a l l due in March, some 8 billions in April, and so on through
the year» The same will hold true f o r years to come — as long as we have
a debt of this magnitude. To have an uncertain or periodically tightened
money market in view of this situation would be as impracticable as i t is
needless*
I append to this statement a table which shows the number of occasions on which the direct purchase authority, granted temporarily in the
Second War Powers Act of 19^2, has since been used* The table shows that
in 19U2, 19U3 and again in 19U5 there were approximately 60 days, a l l of
them falling at periods when the Treasury had to meet large payments, generally f o r interest or f o r redemption of maturing debt, a few days before
large tax receipts were deposited* The Treasury temporarily borrowed from
the Federal Reserve Banks f o r these few days when the Treasury balances at
the Federal Reserve Banks were less than the amounts needed to meet withdrawals* Subsequently these deficiencies were overcome and the Treasury
balances at the Reserve Banks were built up again as deposits were made to
these accounts of tax payments received by Internal Revenue collectors*
The temporary borrowing did not mean that the Treasury had no
funds* It had large deposits in War Loan Accounts with commercial banks
at a l l these periods» Sufficient funds could have been transferred from
the War Loan Accounts to the Federal Reserve Banks to cover a l l expenditures* However, transfer of funds from the commercial banks to the Federal Reserve Banks f o r this purpose would have l e f t the Treasury, after
the tax receipts had come in, with a much larger balance at the Reserve
Banks than i t needed and thus would have unduly reduced bank reserves f o r
an extended period* If commercial banks are faced at tax periods not only
with deposit withdrawals to meet tax payments but also with drains on their
War Loan Accounts, they would have to follow one of four courses: If they
had sufficient excess reserves with the Federal Reserve Banks they could
reduce their reserve balances to the extent necessary. If they did not
have excess reserves — this normally is the case — they would have to
s e l l sufficient securities to obtain the funds, or they could withdraw
correspondent balances, or they could borrow from the Reserve Banks. All
of these alternatives would tend to tighten money market conditions at a
time when taxpayers would be drawing on their bank accounts to make their
tax payments* In other words, i f the Treasury could not borrow temporarily from the Federal Reserve Banks at thsse tax payment periods, and in

this way avoid withdrawals from i t s War Loan Accounts to pay off maturing
obligations, money conditions would unduly tighten and tend to unstabilize
the money market and the Government securities market.
This can be avoided by the temporary borrowing until the tax
payments again build up Treasury accounts at the Reserve Banks and provide the Treasury with funds. The operation simply s t a b i l i z e s the market.
That is a l l that happens. The amounts of special c e r t i f i c a t e s shown in
the table are relatively small compared with the size of the public debt
and the recurring maturities. For instance, on June 16, 19^4-2 and f o r four
days thereafter, the Treasury had borrowings varying from 58 to 9U million
dollars.
The largest occurred in the middle of March of 19^3 > when the
highest amount borrowed was $1,302,000,000 on March 15* The borrowing was
entirely paid off by the end of the month.
As I have indicated, the authority existed f o r more than twenty
years prior to 1935* I t i s more needed than ever today because of the
size of the debt and the refinancing operations.
The f a c t that tax c o l lections are also very large, currently about ¡4O b i l l i o n s a year, means
that quarterly withdrawals from the banking system are going to continue
to be heavy, so that i t w i l l be desirable to have the authority to help
in stabilizing the money market at tax dates.
