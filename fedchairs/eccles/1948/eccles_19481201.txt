The following i s a statement given t o the press by Governor M. S. Iccles
on Wednesday, December 1, 1948, at 7*40 p.m.:

I was informed t h i s afternoon that a formal motion was f i l e d by
Transamerica, i n the proceeding which the Federal Reserve Board has
i n s t i t u t e d tinder the Clayton *ct, to disqualify me from participating
i n the Board1 s deliberations thereon*
I should l i k e t o make i t clear that the Board has understood f o r
sometime that I have d i s q u a l i f i e d myself from the proceeding f o r the
reason that I am going t o be a witness i n the case.

Ever since t h i s

proceeding was instituted, Transamerica has from time t o time charged
i n the press that the proceeding i t s e l f came about as a result of my
personal bias against A. P* Giannini and his associates i n Transamerica.
One of the reasons I agreed t o the request of Counsel f o r the Board t o
appear as a witness i n the case was i n order t o dispel once and for a l l
the idea that there could be any truth i n these charges*

I am informed

that upon taking the witness stand 1 subject myself t o such examination
as Counsel f o r Transamerica may see f i t t o conduct*

Therefore, i f there

i s any truth i n these charges, Transamerica w i l l have every opportunity
t o v e r i f y them*
