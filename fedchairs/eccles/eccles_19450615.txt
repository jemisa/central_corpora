BOARD OF GOVERNORS
OF THE
FEDERAL SBSEHVE SYSTEM
FOR THE -PRESS
F6r immediate release

June 15, 19U5

Statement of Marriner S. Eccles, Chairman of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Banking and Currency Committee of the House of Representatives,
June 15, 19U5, on extension of the Emergency Price Control
Act of 19U2.
It would make just as much sense to scrap or cripple the Price Control
Act at this stage of the fight against inflation on the.home front as it would to
lay down our arms now that final victory is in sight on the battle front» The
safety and security of this Nation depend upon winning on both fronts» To lose
the battle here at home would be a betrayal of all of our armed forces and countless millions of loyal Americans who have faithfully supported the price control
measures, vexatious and irritating as this necessary wartime regimentation of our
economy inevitably is.
-Chester Bowles, his staff and army in the field, composed mainly of
volunteers, are the often criticized, unsung heroes of this war. The problems
they have faced have been as formidable as any that have ever confronted us. They
have made mistakes, as who has not in these years of crisis? Seeing' only the imPerfectionswe sometimes lose sight of the magnificent achievement. Subjecting

) million people to price and rent controls and rationing, all of which are
interferences with our daily lives and cherished freedom of action, is one of the
most difficult tasks imaginable in a democracy. I am in close contact with
officials who have responsibility for the economic stabilization program, and I
know that without exception they will welcome the day when the danger on the home
front has passed and these protective controls can be laid aside, together with
the destructive instruments of war. No one would have believed in 191+2 that we
could have created in these war years the inflationary high explosives that have
accumulated and yet protect the home front as well as has been done.
As time passes and the line is held successfully, if not perfectly, we
tend to lose perspective and to forget that the national debt has already risen
from less than
billions in 19U0 — a figure that many thought perilous then —
to approximately 2J?0 billions at present, and is still mounting. This huge debt
has its reflection in a corresponding accumulation of spendable dollars in the
hands of the public while the supply of civilian goods and services has continued
to shrink.
As the war continues and these inflationary pressures grow greater
daily, it is all the more imperative that this legislation pass, because bound up
in it is the high confidence that the American people have had and continue to
have that the home front will be protected, that the purchasing power of the
billions of dollars invested in Government bonds by soldier, sailor and civilian

alike, will be maintained« This depends in large part upon continuance of the
Price Control Act which is the mainstay of our line of defense at home»
Certainly there is no higher obligation to all our armed services than
to protect their stake in this country, their savings, their war insurance, their
dismissal pay, their benefits under the (5,1* Bill of Rights, and the veterans1
compensation for the sick and wounded and their dependents» Their families and
all who have put their faith in the obligations of the Government, who look to
future benefits from their savings, insurance, social security, Civil Service retirement, and innumerable other pension systems and funds devoted to educational,
religious and philanthropic causes -- they deserve, now have, and must continue to
have the protection afforded by this legislation,
Inflationary dangers grow greater, not less, as the war continues, and
as long as we continue to deal with effects rather th'an with basic causes9 Price
and wage controls, rationing and other measures necessary to hold the line deal,
of course, with effects, not with causes» To get at the causes we should have imposed far higher taxes or greatly economized in war and other expenditures, thus
leaving more goods and services available for civilian use with less excess money
in the hands of the public» As this has not been done, we must continue to maintain the controls essential to hold back the enormous and increasing1 inflationary
pressures,
As Mr» Bowles has said, what is needed in the end to prevent inflation
is an avalanche of civilian goods, and services» To the extent that we can have
reductions in war expenditures, the pressures can be lessened by increasing the
supply of goods and services for the civilian economy» In my opinion, heavy cutbacks are possible without interference with the successful prosecution of the
against Japan»
^^
After final victory has been won and reconversion-has been accomplished,
civilian demand can be completely met by fully employing our manpower and material
resources in peacetime pproduction, and creation of further inflatioxmry forces
should be ended by reduction qf public expenditures and by maintaining such taxes
as are necessary to bring about a balanced 'budgetf
I want to emphasize as forcefully as possible the. importance.of passing
this legislation without the Wherry or other crippling amendments» It would be
better never to pass the legislation than to deceive the public by passing it in
a form that would prove unworkable and thus ineffective.
As lawmakers you know that all law rests oh the consent of the governed*
This legislation cannot be effective unless it has public acceptance, unless the
need for it in the public interest is generally understood» The Congress, by overwhelmingly supporting this legislation, can do much by its actioh alone to foster
public acceptance of and confidence in the need for this protective measure» T/Vhat
a national tragedy it would be to win the victories overs-eas and lose the battle
against inflation at homef
