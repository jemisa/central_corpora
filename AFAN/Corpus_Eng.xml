				<InitialSituation>IN a distant country, a country far away, once there 
lived a Tsar and Tsaritsa, who had a son, Ivan Tsarevich, 
who was dumb from his birth. When he was twelve 
years old he went to the stable to the groom whom he 
loved, who always told him stories. But this time he was 
not to be told any. 
</InitialSituation>

			<Villainy subtype="ThreatOfCannibalismAmongRelatives">

" Ivan Tsarevich," said the groom, " your mother will 
soon have a daughter, and you will have a sister. She 
will be a dreadful witch and will eat up your father and 
your mother and all their subjects. Go back home and 
ask your father to give you his best horse ; mount that 
and ride away and follow your eyes if you would escape 
misfortune."
</Villainy>

Ivan Tsarevich ran up to his father and spoke for the 
first time in his life. The Tsar was so glad at this that he 
never asked what the Tsarevich wanted the horse for, but 
ordered the very best of his Tabun to be saddled for him. 

</ConnectiveIncident>
			<Departure>

Ivan Tsarevich mounted the horse and rode away, 
following his eyes. He rode far, to a very great distance, 
and he came to two old seamstresses, and asked them if 
they would not let him live with them.

" We should be very glad to accept you, Ivan Tsare- 
vich," they replied, " but we shall not live much longer. 
We are breaking up this box and with our needles 
sewing it together again, and as soon as we have done 
that Death will come to us." 

Then Ivan Tsarevich wept and rode on farther. And 
he rode on, very very far, and came to Vertodub. And 
he begged him, " Will you take me as your son ? " 

" I should be very glad to take you," Vertodub replied, 


" but, as soon as I have turned round all these oaks with 
all their roots, the hour will have come for me to die." 

Then the Tsarevich wept yet more, and he rode 
farther on, and he came to Vertogor, and he made him 
the same request. 

" I should be very glad to take you, Ivan Tsarevich, 
but I too shall not live much longer," was the answer he 
received. " You see, I am placed here in order to turn 
these mountains round ; and when I have done with the 
last of them then I must die." 

Then Ivan Tsarevich wept bitter tears, and he rode 
yet farther. And at last he came to the Sister of the 
Sun. She gave him meat and drink and adopted him as 
a son. The Tsarevich had a fine time there. But still 
he was always dissatisfied, because he did not know what 
was going on at home. And so he climbed a 
lofty mountain, looked out to his own house, and saw that 
everything there had been eaten up, and only the walls were 
standing. Then he sighed and wept. 

And when he came down from the mountain, the 
Sister of the Sun met him and asked, " Ivan Tsarevich, 
why hast thou wept ? " 

" It was the wind which was blowing something in 
my eye ! " And once again he began to weep. 

And he went a second time into the mountain, and 
saw that only the walls of his house remained standing 
everything had been eaten up. And he wept and returned home. 

Again the Sister of the Sun met him : " Ivan Tsarevich, why hast thou wept ? " 

" It was the wind which was blowing something in 
my eye ! " And the Sun was angry, and forbade the 
wind to blow. 

And he mounted the hill a third time, and this time 
he was forced to say why he was sad, and beg the Sister 
of the Sun for leave to go home to see what had been 



happening, like a doughty youth. So she gave him a 
brush and comb and two apples to take with him. And, 
however old a man might be, if he only ate one apple, he 
would be young once more. 

Ivan ran away, and he found Vertogor, who had only 
one mountain left. So Ivan Tsarevich took his brush, 
and threw it into the open field. And suddenly moun- 
tains grew up everywhere, and their summits and peaks 
pierced into the skies, and there were so .many of them 
that no man could count them. Vertogor was then very 
happy and set about work gaily. 

Ivan Tsarevich met Vertodub once more, and there 
were only three oaks left. So he threw the comb into the 
field, and then there rustled out of the earth a thick oak 
forest, every tree thicker than the other. And Vertodub 
was then very joyous and set to work gaily. 

And at last, after a journey long or short, Ivan Tsare- 
vich reached the old women, and he gave each of them 
an apple. They ate them, and they once more became 
young, and gave him a little handkerchief, which he need 
only shake, and a big lake would appear

When Ivan Tsarevich came home, his sister ran to 
him and caressed him. " Sit down, brother mine ; play 
on the harp whilst I go and prepare dinner." 

Ivan Tsarevich sat down and began to finger the strings 
when a mouselet crept out of the corner and spoke with 
a human voice : " Run away, Tsarevich, as fast as you 
can. Your sister is now whetting her teeth." 
	</Villainy>
			<Departure>

Ivan Tsarevich then left the room, sat on his horse, 
and went all the way back to the Sun. The mouse let 
ran up and down on the strings of the harp, and the 
sister never noticed that the brother had gone away. 
When she had sharpened her teeth, she ran into the room, 
but there was not a single soul to be seen there, even the 
mouselet had crept back into its hole. And the witch 
became furious, gnashed her teeth and made ready to 
pursue Ivan Tsarevich. Ivan Tsarevich heard a noise 
behind him, looked, and saw his sister had almost caught 
him up, so he waved his handkerchief, and a deep lake 
rose behind him. Whilst the witch was swimming 
through the lake Ivan Tsarevich flew a vast way, and she 
was swifter than he, and again came near. </Departure>

Vertodub guessed Ivan was fleeing from his sister, and 
piled oaks on the way, whirled a vast mass of them in 
her path and she could not get through ; she had at 
first to clear the road. So she gnawed and gnawed away, 
and at last made herself a path. But Ivan Tsarevich in 
the meantime had gained ground. So she followed him 
farther, and she had almost caught him up.  </Struggle>
				<Victory>


When Vertogor saw what was happening, he seized 
hold of the highest mountain, piled it up on the road 
and stuck another on top of it. And the witch was very 
furious, and began climbing up, and in the meantime 
Ivan Tsarevich got far and far away. But the witch 
soon got up and cried out : " This time you shall not 
escape me." 
The witch asked him to give her her brother, but the 
Sun would not. Then the witch said, " Ivan Tsarevich 
must put himself on one balance and I will put myself 
on the other, and if I am the heavier I will eat him up ; 
and, if he is the heavier he shall lay me low."  </Victory>

				<RescueOfHero subtype="SomethingThrownInPath">He had got into the palace of the Sister of the Sun, 
and cried out, " Sun, Sun ! open your big windows." 
The Sun opened his window and Ivan Tsarevich leaped 
in on his horse. So they went and set up the scales. 
First Ivan Tsarevich sat down on it, then the witch on the other side ; 
but as soon as ever she had put her foot into it the 
Tsarevich was hurled with such force into the house, 
that he flew right into the very bosom of the sky, into 
the chambers of the Sun, whilst the witch remained on 
the earth.
