 Once there was an ambitious woman. When her husband came home from the village council she asked him: "What did the council deliberate about?" "We did not deliberate about anything; we gathered to elect a new mayor." "And whom did you elect?" "For the time being, no one." "Elect me, then," said the woman. And so the husband went to the council (his wife was a bad one and he wanted to teach her a lesson) and reported this to the elders; they immediately elected her mayoress. So she began to rule and judge; she drank wine with the peasants, and took bribes. 
 The time came for collecting the poll tax. The mayoress was unable to collect it on time. A Cossack came and asked for the mayor, but the woman upon hearing that he had arrived ran home to hide. "Where shall I hide?" she asked her husband. "Dear little husband, tie me up in a bag and put me over there with the bags of grain!" There were about five bags of spring seed in the room. The peasant tied up the mayoress and put her among the bags. The Cossack came and he said: "Oho, the mayor has hidden himself!" And he began to lash the bag with his whip. The woman roared at the top of her lungs: "Oh, little father, I don't want to be mayoress, I don't want to be mayoress!" The Cossack gave her a good thrashing and left, and thereafter the woman no longer wanted to be mayoress, and obeyed her husband.
