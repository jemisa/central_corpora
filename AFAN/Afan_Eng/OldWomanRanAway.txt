AN OLD MAN AND His wife sat on the stove. The old woman looked at the field through the window and said: "If we had a little son Ivanushko and a little daughter Alion-ushka, our son would have plowed the field and sowed grain, the grain would have grown, and our daughter would have mowed it; I would have grown malt, brewed beer, and invited all my kin, but I would not have invited your kin!" "No, invite mine, but not yours!" said the old man. "No, no, I will 
 
 invite my own folk, not yours!" The old man jumped up and began to drag his wife by her braid; he dragged and dragged her and finally pushed her off the stove. 
 Then the old man went to get wood and the old woman made ready to run away; she baked bread and pies, put them in a big bag, and went to say farewell to a neighbor. Somehow the old man got wind of it, returned home, took out of the bag everything his wife had prepared for her trip, put the bread and the pies in the larder, and himself sat in the bag. The old woman came home, placed the bag on her shoulders, and set out on her journey. 
 After walking for five or six versts, she stopped and said: "It would be nice to sit on a tree stump now and eat a cake." The old man cried from the bag: "I can see everything, I can hear everything!" "Ah, the accursed devil, he might catch me!" thought the old woman, and went on. Again she walked for about six versts, and said: "It would be nice to sit on a tree stump now and eat a cake." "I can see everything, I can hear everything!" cried the old man. Again she hurried on; she walked many versts, and not having eaten or drunk anything, she got so tired that her strength failed her. "Come what may, I will stop here," thought the old woman. "I will have a little rest and a bite." 
 Then she discovered that her husband was in the bag. She begged him: "Little father, forgive me, I will never try to run away again!" 
 The old man forgave her, and they went home together.
