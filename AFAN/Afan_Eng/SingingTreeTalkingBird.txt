 ONCE there was a very curious king who eavesdropped at the windows of his subjects. A certain merchant had three daughters, and one day the king heard these maidens conversing with their father. One said: "I wish I were married to the king's caterer!" The second daughter said: "If only the king's body servant would take me for his wife!" And the third daughter said: "And I should like to be married to the king himself; I would bear him two sons and one daughter." 
 Some time later the king fulfilled their wishes: he married the eldest daughter to his caterer, the second daughter to his body servant, and the youngest he took to wife himself. He lived happily with his wife, and she became pregnant; when her time came she began to have labor pains. The king wanted to send for the midwife of the city, but the king's sisters-in-law 
 
 said: "Why send for a midwife? We ourselves can do what is necessary." When the queen gave birth to a son, these mid-wives told the king that his wife had given birth to a puppy, put the newborn boy in a box, and dropped it in the pond in the king's garden. The king became enraged at his wife and wanted to have her shot; but visiting kings dissuaded him from this, arguing that a first offense should be forgiven. So the king forgave her, postponing punishment against a second time. 
 A year later the queen again became pregnant and bore a son; this time her sisters told the king that she had given birth to a kitten. The king became even more enraged and wanted to put his wife to death, but he was again dissuaded after many entreaties, and postponed punishment against a third time. The sisters put the second baby likewise into a box and dropped it into the pond. Then the queen became pregnant for the third time, and bore a beautiful daughter; the sisters reported to the king that his wife had given birth to God knows what. The king became more enraged than before, had gallows erected, and wanted to hang his wife; but some kings who had come from other countries to visit him, said to him: "Rather, build a chapel next to the church, and put your wife in it; whoever goes to mass is to spit in her face." The king followed this advice; and people not only spat in the queen's face but hurled at her whatever they had in their hands, loaves of bread or cakes. As for the babies brought into the world by the queen and dropped by her midwives into the pond, the king's gardener took them into his house and brought them up. 
 These children of the king grew not by the year, but by the month-not by the day, but by the hour. The princes became handsome youths such as no mind can imagine nor pen describe; and the princess was such a beauty that she took one's breath away! And they came of age and asked the gardener to allow them to build a house outside the town. The gardener gave them his permission, they built a fine big house, and began to live happily. The brothers loved to catch hares; one day they went hunting, and the sister remained at home alone. A little old woman came to the house and said to the maiden: "Your house is comfortable and beautiful, but you lack three 
 
 things." The princess asked her: "What do we lack? It seems to me we have everything." The aged woman said: "This is what you lack-the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life." 
 The brothers returned from the hunt and the sister went out to meet them and said: "My brothers, we have everything except three things." The brothers asked her: "What do we not have, little sister?" She said: "We do not have the talking bird, the singing tree, nor the water of life." The elder brother began to beg her: "Little sister, give me your blessing, I will go forth to get these marvels. And if I die or am killed, this is how you will know it: I will thrust this penknife into the wall; when blood begins to drip from the knife, it will be a sign that I am dead." 
 He left, and having walked for a long time, he came to a wood. A little old man sat on a tree, and the prince asked him: "How can I get the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life?" The man gave him a little spool and said: "Follow this spool wherever it rolls." The spool began to roll and the prince followed it; it rolled up to a high mountain and vanished from sight. The prince started to climb up the mountain, reached a point halfway to the top, and then suddenly vanished too. At his house blood at once dripped from his penknife, and the sister said to the younger brother that their elder brother had surely died. The younger brother said to her: "Now I will go, little sister, to get the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life." She gave him her blessing and he left; after having walked for a long time, he came to a wood. A little old man sat on a tree, and the prince asked him: "Little grandfather, how can I get the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life?" The little old man said: "Here is a spool for you. Follow it wherever it rolls." The old man threw the spool, it began to roll, and the prince followed it; it rolled up to a high mountain and vanished from sight; the prince started climbing the mountain, reached the halfway point, and suddenly vanished too. 
 The sister waited for him, many many years, and still he did not come back. Then she said: "My second brother too must 
 
 have died." And she went herself to get the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life. She walked for some time, a short time or a long time, and came to a wood. On the tree there sat a little old man, and she asked him: "Little grandfather, how can I get the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life?" The little old man answered: "You cannot get them! Cleverer persons than you have tried, but they all perished." The maiden still begged him: "Please tell me." And the little old man said to her: "Here is a spool; follow it." After some time, a short time or a long time, this spool rolled up to a high mountain; the maiden began to climb it, and she heard voices shouting at her: "Whither are you going? We shall kill you! We shall devour you!" But she kept on climbing and climbing; she came to the top of the mountain, and there sat the talking bird. 
 The maiden took this bird and asked it: "Tell me where I can get the singing tree and the water of life?" The bird said: "Go over there." She came to the singing tree; in this tree all kinds of birds were singing. She broke a branch off it and went on farther; she came to the water of life, drew a little pitcher of it, to take it home. She began to climb down the mountain and sprinkled it with the water of life; suddenly her brothers jumped up and said: "Ah, little sister, we have been asleep a long time." "Yes, brothers, were it not for me you would have slept here forever." And she added: "I have got the talking bird, the singing tree, and the water of life." The brothers were overjoyed. They went home and planted the singing tree in their garden; it spread out over the whole garden and birds sang on it in various voices. 
 One day the brothers went hunting and happened to meet the king. He liked these hunters and asked them to come to see him. They said: "We shall ask our sister's permission; if she grants it, we shall certainly come." They returned from the hunt, the sister met them, and attended them joyfully. Her brothers said to her: "Give us permission, little sister, to visit the king; he graciously asked us to come." The princess gave them permission, and they went to visit the king. The king received them cordially and invited them to feast with him; 
 
 they spoke to the king and asked him to visit them in turn. After some time, the king came to them and they received him most hospitably, and showed him the singing tree and the talking bird. The king was amazed and said: "I am a king, and yet I do not have these things." Then the sister and the brothers said to him: "But we are your children." The king learned the whole truth, was overjoyed, and stayed with them forever; he freed the queen from the chapel, and they lived together for many years in great happiness.
