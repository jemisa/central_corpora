 IN A certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a peasant who had two sons. The elder son was drafted to serve as a soldier. He served his sovereign loyally and truthfully, and was so fortunate that in a few years he was promoted to the rank of general. At that time there was a new recruitment, and his younger brother was taken into service; the boy had his skull shaved, and it so happened that he was sent to the same regiment in which his brother was a general. The new recruit recognized the general, but he got nothing for his trouble; his brother said bluntly: "I don't know you, and don't you try to know me." 
 One day the soldier stood on guard near the general's quarters; the general was then giving a banquet, and many officers and fine gentlemen had come to attend it. The soldier saw that others were feasting and making merry while he had nothing, and began to weep bitter tears. The guests asked him: "Soldier, why are you weeping?" "How can I help weeping?" he said. "My own brother is making merry and does not remember me." 
 
 The guests told this to the general, who fell into a rage: "Don't believe him, he is lying, the fool!" He ordered his brother to be relieved of guard duty and to be punished with three hundred lashes for having dared to claim kinship with the general. The soldier felt humiliated; he put on his campaign suit and deserted from the regiment. 
 After a long time or a short time, he came to a thick forest that was almost never entered by anyone, and stayed there, living on berries and roots. Soon afterward the king went hunting, accompanied by a great retinue; they galloped in the open field, set their hounds loose, blew their trumpets, and began to enjoy themselves. Suddenly a beautiful stag darted past the king and jumped into a river; he swam across and vanished in the forest. The king swam across and galloped after him for a long time. He looked about him, but the stag was out of sight; the other hunters remained far behind and he was surrounded by a dark, thick forest. He did not know where to go, there was no path in sight. He wandered until sunset and grew very tired. He met the runaway soldier, who said: "Good evening, my good fellow, how have you happened to come here?" "I went out hunting and lost my way in the woods," said the king. "Lead me out to the road, brother." "But who are you?" "A servant of the king." "Well, it is dark now; let us go to spend the night in a ravine, and tomorrow morning I shall lead you out to the road." 
 They went to find a place to spend the night, and after some time saw a little hut. "God has been kind to us and showed us a shelter," said the soldier. "Let us go in." They entered the hut, and inside they found an old woman. "Good evening, grandmother," said the soldier. "Good evening, soldier." "Give us food and drink." "I would gladly eat myself, but I have nothing in the house." "You are lying, old hag!" said the soldier, and began to rummage in the stove and on the shelves. He discovered that the old woman was well supplied with wine and all kinds of food. They sat at table, had a good supper, and went to sleep in the attic. The soldier said to the king: "God protects him who protects himself. Let one of us rest while the other keeps watch." They cast lots, and it fell to the king to keep 
 
 watch first. The soldier gave the watcher his short saber, and stationed him at the door, bidding the king not to fall asleep and to rouse him at once should something happen; then he went to sleep, wondering whether his companion would be a good guard. "Perhaps he won't be able to keep awake from lack of habit," he thought, "but I will keep an eye on him." 
 The king stood for some time, then he began to feel sleepy. "Why are you swaying?" the soldier called to him. "Are you sleepy?" "No," said the king. "Be careful!" said the soldier. The king stood for a quarter of an hour and again began to drowse. "Eh, friend," said the soldier, "aren't you sleeping?" "No, I have no intention of sleeping." "Well, should you fall asleep, you will have to answer for it." The king stood for another quarter of an hour; his legs gave way under him, he dropped on the ground and fell asleep. The soldier jumped up, took his saber, and began to thrash the king, repeating: "Is that the way to keep watch? I served ten years, and my superiors never forgave me a single mistake; apparently you have never been taught anything. I forgave you the first and the second time, but the third fault cannot be forgiven. Well, lie down to sleep now, I will keep watch myself." 
 The king lay down to sleep and the soldier stood guard. Suddenly there was a noise of stamping and whistling: robbers had come to the hut, and the old woman went out to meet them and said: "We have guests here." "That is fine, grandmother! We have been riding all night for nothing, and our luck has now come to our house. But first let us eat supper. "But our guests have eaten and drunk everything." "They must be bold fellows! Where are they?" "They went to sleep in the attic." "Well," said one of the robbers, "I'll go up and take care of them." He took a big knife and began to climb to the attic, but he had no sooner stuck his head through the door than the soldier swung his saber, and the head rolled. The soldier pulled in the body and stood waiting to see what would happen next. The robbers waited and waited, and said: "Why is he dallying there all this time?" They sent another one of their band; the soldier slew him too. Thus in a short time he slew all the robbers. 
 
 At daybreak the king awoke, saw the corpses, and asked: "Hey, soldier, what kind of place is this?" The soldier told him about everything that had happened, and then they went down from the attic. The soldier saw the old woman and cried: "Wait, you old hag! I'll settle your account. So that's what your house is-a robbers' den! Give me all your money at once!" The old woman opened a chest filled with gold; the soldier poured gold into his knapsack, stuffed all his pockets, and said to his companion: "Take some too!" The king answered: "No, brother, I don't need it; our king has plenty of money even without this, and since he has it, we too can have it." "Well, just as you like," said the soldier, and led him out of the woods. When they came to the highway, the soldier said: "Follow this road; in an hour you will be in town." "Farewell," said the king, "thanks for your kindness. Come to visit me; I'll help you make your fortune, man." "It's no use lying to you, I am a deserter and if I show myself in town, I will be caught at once." "Do not doubt my word, soldier! The king favors me very much; if I speak to him on your behalf, and tell him about your courage, he will not only forgive you but even reward you." "But where can I find you?" "Come straight to the royal palace." "Very well, then; I'll come tomorrow." 
 The king took leave of the soldier, went along the highway, came to his capital, and without waiting gave orders to all the guardhouses, posts, and patrols to be on the alert and as soon as a certain soldier showed himself, to give him the honors due a general. Next day, as soon as the soldier appeared at the city gate, all the guards ran out and saluted him as they would a general. The soldier wondered what that could mean, and asked: "Whom are you saluting?" they answered: "You, soldier!" He took a handful of gold out of his knapsack and gave it to the guards as a tip. He walked in the town; wherever he appeared, the guards saluted him-he hardly had time to tip them all. "What a chatterbox the king's servant is!" thought the soldier. "He has blurted out to everyone that I have plenty of money." He came to the palace, and there troops had been assembled and the king met him, dressed in the same clothes in which he had gone hunting. 
 
 When the soldier realized with whom he had spent the night in the'woods, he was terribly frightened. "So this is the king," he thought. "And I thrashed him with my saber as though he were a comrade." The king took him by his hand, thanked him before the assembled troops for rescuing his king, and rewarded him with the rank of general. At the same time the king demoted the elder brother and made him a simple private, to teach him not to disavow his own kin in the future.
