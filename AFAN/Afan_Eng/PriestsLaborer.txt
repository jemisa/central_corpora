IN A certain village a priest hired a laborer and sent him to plow a field with his dog. He gave him a whole loaf of bread and said to him: "Here, laborer, eat your fill yourself, let the dog eat his fill, and bring back the loaf whole." 
 The laborer took the loaf, went to the field, and began to plow. He plowed and plowed; then it seemed to him that it was time to still his hunger, for his stomach was all hollow. But how could he eat without disobeying the priest's orders? However, hunger is not to be trifled with, it teaches a man to be cunning. And so the laborer concocted a plan. He removed the upper crust of his loaf, picked out all the soft part, ate his fill and fed the dog, then put the crust back as it was before. He plowed on cheerfully until nightfall as though nothing had happened. At nightfall he went home. 
 The priest went out to meet him at the gate and asked: "Well, laborer, did you eat your fill?" The laborer answered: "I did." The priest asked: "And has the dog been fed?" The laborer answered: "He has." The priest asked: "Is the loaf whole?" The laborer answered: "It is whole, little father." When the priest examined it, he laughed and said: "Ah, you are a cunning fellow, I see that you will do well. I like you for your cleverness. Stay with me, I need such as you." And he kept him, adding to the wages agreed upon because he was glad to have got such a smart fellow as a laborer. And the laborer began to roll in butter and to live so well that he hoped he would never die.
