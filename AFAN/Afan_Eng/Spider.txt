 In days of yore, in very, very olden times, one lovely spring, one hot summer, a great plague spread over the world: mosquitoes and midges in great swarms began to bite people and drink their blood. Then a spider came, a brave knight, and he began to twist his legs and weave his webs in the paths of the mosquitoes and the midges. A dirty fly fell into the spider's web, and the spider began to beat her, torment her, strangle her. The fly implored the spider: "Little father spider, do not beat me, do not kill me; I would leave behind many orphans who would fly into all the yards and annoy the dogs." The spider let her go. She flew away buzzing and announced to all the mosquitoes and midges: "Hey, you mosquitoes and midges, hide under the aspen tree root; a spider has come who 
 
 twists his legs and weaves his webs in the paths of mosquitoes and midges; he'll catch you all." 
 They flew away, hid under the aspen tree root, and lay as though dead. The spider called together a cricket, a beetle, and a wood bug: "You, cricket, sit on a cabbage and smoke a pipe of tobacco; you, beetle, beat a drum; and you, wood bug, go to the aspen tree root, and spread the news that I, the valiant spider, the brave knight, am no longer alive. Say that I was sent to Kazan, that in Kazan my head was cut off on the block and the block was cleft asunder." The cricket sat on a cabbage and smoked a pipe of tobacco; the beetle beat a drum, and the wood bug went to the aspen tree root, and said: "Why do you hide, why do you lie as though dead? The valiant spider, the brave knight, is no longer alive; he was sent to Kazan, and in Kazan his head was cut off on the block and the block was cleft asunder." They cheered and rejoiced, made the sign of the cross, flew away, and all fell into the spider's webs. He said: "You're nice little things! You should visit me more often, drink beer and wine, and treat yourselves fine!"
