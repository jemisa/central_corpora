 A raven flew above the sea, looked down, and saw a lobster. She grabbed him and took him to the woods, intending to perch somewhere on a branch and eat a good meal. The lobster saw that his end was coming and said to the raven: "Eh, raven, raven, I knew your father and mother, they were fine people!" "Humph!" answered the raven, without opening her mouth. "And I know your brothers and sisters, too; what fine people they are!" "Humph!" "But although they are all fine people, they are not equal to you. I think that in the whole world there is no one wiser than you." "Aha!" cawed the raven, opening her mouth wide, and dropped the lobster into the sea.
