 TWO old beggars, husband and wife, were walking along a road and approached a village. The old man said: "I will ask for some milk." His wife answered: "And I will crumb some bread into the milk." The man seized her and began to beat her, saying: "Don't crumb bread into the milk, it will get sour; don't crumb bread into the milk, it will get sour." But when they came to the village no one gave them milk.
