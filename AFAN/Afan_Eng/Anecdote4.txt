 A peasant bought a quart of wine, drank it, and felt no effects. He bought a pint-and still was not drunk. He drank a half-pint and became drunk. Then he began to feel sorry for himself: "Why did I buy the quart and the pint? I should have bought the half-pint to begin with. That would have done the job!"
