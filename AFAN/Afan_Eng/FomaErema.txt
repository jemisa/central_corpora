 OH, Foma and Erema, two brothers they were Alike in body, alike in mind. Alike their noses, their eyes, their hair- Oh, two such brothers you'll seldom find. One day the two went to church to pray, One in a pew, the other at the altar. Erema took hymnal, Foma took psalter; Erema recited and Foma prayed And this was heard by priests who stayed On hilltops, learned priests devout Who came to church and kicked them out, One out the window and one out the door, And they hastened away for evermore. They went to the woods where later they met And there they decided gray rabbits to get, Gray rabbits, fast runners, to hunt and to kill, But none could they find in hollow or hill. Instead they went to the river banks steep, 
 
 To river banks steep where waters ran deep. 
 Two ducks a-swimming they saw down below, 
 One duck was white, the other like snow. 
 Erema took stick, and Foma grasped knife, 
 Each was longing to take a duck's life. 
 But Foma threw far, Erema too near, 
 And the ducks swam away, swam away from there. 
 The brothers then thought to catch some fish, 
 To catch some fish was now their wish. 
 Oh, Erema sat in a deep-bottomed boat, 
 But the boat had no floor and would not float. 
 And Foma did sit him down in a barge 
 That had no bottom but was very large. 
 Three years they sank but could not drown; 
 Three devils in vain tried to pull them down. 
 The brothers now wished their bodies to feed, 
 To feed their bodies was now their need. 
 They made up their minds to plow their fields 
 To take whatever the good earth yields. 
 To market went Foma, Erema to fair, 
 A foal and a colt the brothers bought there. 
 Erema's colt refused to work, 
 And Foma's foal his tasks did shirk. 
 The brothers then slew their horses, they say, 
 And ran from the fields, oh, quickly away!
