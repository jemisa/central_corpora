Billy goat, billy goat, where have you been? I was grazing horses. And where are the horses? Nikolka led them away. 
 
 And where is Nikolka? 
 He went to the larder. And where is the larder? 
 It was flooded with water. And where is the water? 
 The oxen drank it. And where are the oxen? 
 They went to the mountain. And where is the mountain? 
 The worms gnawed it away. And where are the worms? 
 The geese ate them all. And where are the geese? 
 They went to the junipers. And where are the junipers? 
 The maids broke them. And where are the maids? 
 They all got married. And where are their husbands? 
 They all died.
