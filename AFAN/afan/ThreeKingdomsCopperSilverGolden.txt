 IN A certain kingdom in a certain land lived a king named Byel Byelanin. He had a wife, Nastasya the Golden-tressed, and three sons, the princes Piotr, Vasily, and Ivan. One day the queen went to walk in the garden with her ladies-in-waiting and tirewomen. Suddenly a mighty whirlwind arose 
 
 and-God preserve us!-it seized the queen and carried her off no one knew whither. 
 The king was grieved and distressed and did not know what to do. When the princes grew up, he said to them: "My beloved children, which of you will set out to seek his mother?" The elder brothers made ready and set out, and then the youngest son too begged his father to let him go. "No," said the king, "go not, my little son! do not leave me a lone old man." "Give me leave, father! I greatly long to wander over the white world and find my mother." The king tried hard to dissuade him but could not. Then he said: "Well, there is nothing to be done, so go, and God be with you." 
 Prince Ivan saddled his good steed and set out. He rode and rode, for a long time or a short time. Speedily a tale is spun, with much less speed a deed is done. Finally he came to a forest. In that forest stood a most splendid castle. Prince Ivan drove into the wide courtyard, saw an old man, and said: "Long life to you, old man!" "You are welcome here! Who are you, brave youth?" "I am Prince Ivan, the son of King Byel Byelanin and Queen Nastasya the Golden-tressed." "Ah, my own nephew! Whither is God taking you?" "I am traveling in search of my mother," he said. "Can you not tell me, uncle, where to find her?" "No, my nephew, I know not. But I will help you if I can. Here is a ball. Throw it before you; it will roll and lead you to high, steep mountains. In those mountains is a cave; enter it, take iron claws, put them on your hands and feet, and climb up the mountain. Perhaps there you will find your mother, Nastasya the Golden-tressed." 
 That was good. Prince Ivan said farewell to his uncle and threw the ball before him; the ball rolled and rolled and he rode after it. After a long time or a short time, he beheld his brothers, Piotr and Vasily, encamped in an open field with a multitude of troops. His brothers met him, saying: "So it's you, Prince Ivan? Where are you going?" "Oh," he said, "I grew weary at home and decided to go in search of my mother. Send your troops home and let us travel together." 
 So they did; they dismissed their troops and all three of them rode after the ball. Even from a distance they beheld the 
 
 mountains, so steep and high that-God preserve us!-their peaks leaned against heaven. The ball rolled straight to a cave. Prince Ivan climbed down from his horse and said to his brothers: "Here, brothers, is my good steed; I will go up the mountain to seek my mother, and you remain here. Wait for me exactly three months; if I am not back in three months, it will be of no use to wait any longer." 
 The brothers thought to themselves that climbing up these mountains, anyone might break his head. "Well," they said, "God speed you, we shall wait here." Prince Ivan went to the cave. He saw that the door was of iron, pushed it with all his strength, and opened it. He entered, and the iron claws slipped on his hands and feet of themselves. He began to climb the mountain; he climbed and climbed; he labored for a whole month, and with great effort reached the top. "Well," said he, "thanks be to God!" He rested for a while, then walked along the mountain peaks. He walked and walked and beheld a copper castle; at the gate terrible serpents, hundreds of them, were fastened with copper chains. Near by was a well and at the well a copper bucket hung on a copper chain. Prince Ivan drew water with the bucket and gave it to the serpents to drink. They lay down quietly and he passed into the castle. 
 The queen of the copper kingdom came out to him. "Who are you, brave youth?" "I am Prince Ivan." She asked: "Have you come of your own will or by compulsion, Prince Ivan?" "Of my own will; I am looking for my mother; Nastasya the Golden-tressed. A certain Whirlwind kidnaped her in the garden. Do you know where she is?" "No, I do not. But not far from here you will find my second sister, the queen of the silver kingdom; she may tell you." She gave him a copper ball and a copper ring. "The ball," she said, "will lead you to my second sister, and the whole copper kingdom is in this ring. When you defeat Whirlwind, who keeps me here and flies to me every three months, do not forget me, wretched woman that I am; rescue me from this place and take me with you back to the free world." "I will," answered Prince Ivan, and threw the copper ball. It rolled before him and the prince followed it. He came to the silver kingdom and beheld a castle 
 
 even more splendid than the first. It was all silver; at the gate terrible serpents were fastened with silver chains, and near by was a well with a silver bucket. Prince Ivan drew water, gave it to the serpents to drink, and they lay down quietly and let him pass into the castle. 
 The queen of the silver kingdom came out. "For nearly three years," she said, "mighty Whirlwind has kept me here; I have not heard a Russian voice with my ears, nor caught a glimpse of a Russian man with my eyes, and now a Russian spirit is flesh before my eyes. Who are you, brave youth?" "I am Prince Ivan." "Have you come here of your own will or by compulsion?" "Of my own will. I am looking for my mother; she was walking in the green garden when Whirlwind arose and carried her off, no one knows whither. Do you know where to find her?" "No, I do not; but near here you will find my eldest sister, the queen of the golden kingdom, Elena the Fair; she may tell you. Here is a silver ball. Roll it before you and follow it: it will lead you to the gold kingdom. But mind you, when you kill Whirlwind, do not forget me, wretched woman that I am; free me from this place and take me along with you, back to the free world. Whirlwind keeps me captive here and flies to me every two months." Then she gave him a silver ring, saying: "The whole silver kingdom is in this ring." Prince Ivan rolled the ball; where the ball went, he followed. 
 After a long time or a short time, he saw before him a golden castle gleaming like fire; at the gate teemed terrible serpents fastened with golden chains; near by was a well, and at the well a golden bucket hung on a golden chain. Prince Ivan drew water with the bucket and gave it to the serpents to drink; they lay down quietly. The prince entered the castle and was met by Elena the Fair. "Who are you, good youth?" "I am Prince Ivan." "How have you come here-of your own will or by compulsion?" "I have come of my own will; I am looking for my mother, Nastasya the Golden-tressed. Do you know where to find her?" "Of course I know. She lives not far from here, and Whirlwind flies to her once a week, and to me once a month. Here is a golden ball for you. Roll it before you and follow it; it will lead you where you want to go. And take 
 
 this golden ring too-all of the golden kingdom is in it. Now mind you, prince! When you conquer Whirlwind, do not forget me, wretched woman that I am; take me along with you back to the free world." "Yes," he said, "I will take you." 
 Prince Ivan rolled the ball and followed it. He walked and walked and came to such a castle that-God preserve us!-it nearly dazzled him, so brightly did it gleam with diamonds and precious stones. At the gate six-headed serpents hissed; Prince Ivan gave them water to drink and they lay down quietly and let him pass into the castle. The prince went through great chambers and in the very last one found his mother; she sat on a lofty throne, attired in royal garments and crowned with a precious crown. She looked at the visitor and cried: "Ah my God, is it you, my beloved son? How have you happened to come here?" "Thus and thus," he said. "I have come for you." "Well, little son, you will have a hard time. For in these mountains reigns the wicked, mighty Whirlwind, and all the spirits obey him; it is he who carried me off. You must fight with him. Come quickly to the cellar." 
 They went to the cellar; there stood two tubs of water, one on the right, the other on the left. Queen Nastasya the Golden-tressed said: "Drink some water from the right." Prince Ivan drank. "Now, how much strength is in you?" the queen asked him. "I am so strong that I could overturn this whole castle with one hand." "Now drink some more." The prince drank more. "How much strength is in you now?" "Now, if I wanted to, I could overturn the whole world." "Oh, that is a great deal of strength. Now change these tubs around; put the one on the right to the left, and the one on the left to the right." Prince Ivan took the tubs and changed them around. "You see, my beloved son," said the queen, "one tub contains the water of strength, and the other the water of weakness; he who drinks from the first will be a mighty champion, while he who drinks from the second will be quite helpless. Whirlwind always drinks the water of strength and keeps it in the tub on the right side; so we must deceive him, otherwise you will never be able to get the better of him." 
 They returned to the palace. "Whirlwind will come soon," 
 
 the queen said to Prince Ivan. "Sit under my purple robe so that he will not see you. And when he comes and begins to embrace and kiss me, seize his mace. He will rise very high, he will carry you over seas and precipices; but do you be careful not to let go of the mace. Whirlwind will get tired, he will want to drink the water of strength, he will descend into the cellar, and rush to the tub on the right side; but do you drink from the tub on the left. Then he will become completely powerless and you can wrest his sword from him and with one blow cut off his head. When you cut off his head, you will hear straightway a voice behind you, saying: 'Strike again! strike again!' But do not strike, little son. Instead, answer this: 'A hero's hand does not strike twice; it fells the enemy at one blow.' " 
 Prince Ivan had no sooner hidden under the purple robe than the courtyard grew dark and everything shook: Whirlwind came, struck the earth, turned into a goodly youth, and entered the castle; in his hands he held a battle mace. "Fie, fie, fie!" he shouted. "Why do I smell the Russian breath in here? Did someone come to see you?" The queen answered: "I do not know why you think so." Whirlwind rushed to embrace and kiss her, and Prince Ivan at once seized his mace. "I will devour you," cried Whirlwind. "Well," replied Prince Ivan, "my old grandmother said that of two things one will happen: either you will devour me or you will not." Whirlwind dashed out through the window and soared up to the sky; and he carried Prince Ivan over mountains, on and on, saying: "I will smash you." And he soared over seas, threatening: "I will drown you." But no, the prince did not let go of the mace. 
 Whirlwind flew over the whole world, became tired, and began to descend. He descended straight into the cellar, rushed to the tub on the right side, and began to drink the water of weakness, while Prince Ivan rushed to the left, drank the water of strength, and became the mightiest champion in the whole world. He saw that Whirlwind had lost all his strength, wrested the sharp sword from him, and cut off his head. He heard a voice behind him crying: "Strike again, strike again, else he will come to life!" "No," answered the prince, "a hero's hand 
 
 does not strike twice, but always fells the enemy at one blow." He made a fire at once, burned the body and the head, and scattered the ashes to the wind. 
 Prince Ivan's mother was overjoyed. "Well, my- beloved, son," she said, "let us make merry and eat, and then let us hasten home, for it is wearisome here; there are no people to talk with." "But who serves you?" "Wait and see." They had no sooner thought of eating than the table set itself, and various meats and wines appeared on it of themselves. The queen and the prince dined while invisible musicians played wonderful songs for them. They ate and drank their fill and rested. Then Prince Ivan said: "Let us go, mother, it is time; my brothers are waiting for me at the foot of the mountain. And on our way we must rescue the three queens whom Whirlwind has kept here." 
 They took everything they needed and set out. First they stopped for the queen of the golden kingdom, then for the queen of the silver kingdom, and at last for the queen of the copper kingdom. They took these queens with them and provided themselves with linen and many other things, and in a short time they came to the place where they had to climb down the mountain. Prince Ivan let his mother down first on a linen cloth, then Elena the Fair and her two sisters. The brothers stood below waiting and thought to themselves: "We will leave Prince Ivan up there, and will take our mother and the queens to our father and tell him that we found them." "I shall take Elena the Fair for myself," said Prince Piotr. "You, Vasily, will take the queen of the silver kingdom, and the queen of the copper kingdom we will marry to some general." 
 When Prince Ivan's turn came to descend the mountain, his older brothers seized the cloth, pulled it, and ripped it off. Prince Ivan remained on the mountain. What could he do? He wept bitterly and turned back; he walked and walked, over the copper kingdom, and over the silver kingdom, and over the golden kingdom, but not a soul did he find anywhere! He came to the diamond kingdom, and still there was no one. What was he to do all alone and bored to death? He beheld a reed pipe 
 
 lying on a window. He took it in his hand. "Let me play," he said, "to ease my boredom." He had no sooner put the pipe to his lips than Lame and One-eyed sprang forth. "What do you wish, Prince Ivan?" they said. "I am hungry." 
 Straightway as though from nowhere a table was set, and on the table were choice wines and meats. Prince Ivan ate and he thought: "Now it would not be bad to rest." He blew his reed pipe and Lame and One-eyed appeared, saying: "What do you wish, Prince Ivan?" "That a bed be made ready." He had no sooner said this than a wonderful bed was ready. He lay on it, had a good sleep, and again blew his reed pipe. "What do you wish?" Lame and One-eyed asked him. "So you can do everything?" asked Prince Ivan. "Yes, we can do everything, Prince Ivan, and we will do everything for him who blows this reed pipe. Just as we served Whirlwind before, we are now glad to serve you; only you must always keep this reed pipe with you." "Very well, then," said Prince Ivan, "I want to be in my own kingdom at once." 
 He had no sooner said this than he found himself in his kingdom, in the middle of the market place. He began to walk among the stalls and met a shoemaker-a merry fellow. The prince asked: "Whither are you going, little man?" "I am taking my shoes to sell, for I am a shoemaker." "Take me as your journeyman." "But do you know how to make shoes?" "I can make anything you wish; not only shoes but even clothes." "Well, come with me." 
 They came to the shoemaker's house. The shoemaker said: "Well, set to work! Here is material for you, the very best; let me see how well you can cobble." Prince Ivan went to his room, took out his reed pipe, and Lame and One-eyed appeared. "What do you wish, Prince Ivan?" they asked. "I want a pair of shoes ready by tomorrow." "Oh, that is a tiny service, not a task." "Here is the material." "What sort of material is that? Nothing but trash! Just good enough to throw out the window." 
 Next morning the prince awoke and found on the table a pair of beautiful shoes, of the very best make. The master arose too and said: "Well, my good youth, have you sewn the shoes?" "They are ready." "Show them to me." The shoemaker 
 
 looked at the shoes and gasped: "What a craftsman I have found for myself!" he said. "No, not a craftsman-a real wonder." He took the shoes to sell them on the market place. At that time three weddings were being prepared for at the king's palace: Prince Piotr was making ready to marry Elena the Fair, Prince Vasily was to wed the queen of the silver kingdom, and the queen of the copper kingdom was being given to a general. They began to buy attire for these weddings, and Elena the Fair needed shoes. Our shoemaker's shoes were the best of all, and he was brought to the king's palace. 
 When Elena the Fair looked at the shoes, she said: "What is this? Only in the mountains can such shoes be made." She paid the shoemaker a high price and said to him: "Make me another pair of shoes without taking my measure, and let them be sewn perfectly, ornamented with precious stones, and studded with diamonds. And let them be ready by tomorrow, else you will go to the gallows." 
 The shoemaker took the money and the precious stones and went home a gloomy man! "Woe is me!" he said. "What am I to do now? How can I make such shoes by tomorrow, and without taking her measure into the bargain? Doubtless I shall be hanged in the morning! Let me at least drink down my misfortune with my friends for the last time." He entered an alehouse. He had many friends there and they asked him: "Brother, why are you so gloomy?" "Ah, my beloved friends, I am going to be hanged tomorrow." "But why?" The shoemaker told them of his misfortune. "It's no use trying to work; instead, let us regale ourselves together for the last time." They drank and drank and reveled and reveled till the shoemaker began to reel. "Well," he said, "I shall take a keg of wine home and go to sleep. And tomorrow, as soon as the hangman comes for me, I will drink a couple of gallons; let them hang me unconscious." 
 He came home. "Well, you accursed creature," he said to Prince Ivan, "do you know what your shoes have done for me?" And he told his journeyman the whole story. "Tomorrow when I am sent for," he ordered, "awaken me at once." At night Prince Ivan took out his reed pipe, blew it, and Lame and One- 
 
 eyed appeared. "What do you wish, Prince Ivan?" they asked. "That such and such shoes be ready." "They will be." Prince Ivan lay down to sleep; next morning he awoke and beheld the shoes on the table, gleaming like fire. He went to rouse his master, saying: "Master, it is time to arise." "What? Have I been sent for? Give me the keg of wine at once! Here is a cup, pour the wine, let them hang me drunk." "But the shoes are ready." "What do you mean? Where are they?" The master ran to see them. "Ah," he said, "but when did we make them?" "In the night; don't you remember, master, how we cut and sewed them?" "I have been sound asleep, brother; I can barely remember anything." 
 The shoemaker took the shoes, wrapped them up, and ran to the palace. Elena the Fair saw the shoes and thought: "Surely, the spirits made them for Prince Ivan." Then she asked the shoemaker: "How did you make these?" "Oh," he said, "I can do everything." "If so, make me a wedding gown, and let it be embroidered with gold and studded with diamonds and precious stones. And let it be ready tomorrow morning, else your head will roll." 
 Again the shoemaker went home gloomy, and found that his friends had been waiting for him a long time. "Well, how was it?" they asked him. "What do you think?" he said. "Nothing but accursed trouble! The enemy of all Christian souls has come; she ordered me to make her a wedding gown with gold and precious stones for tomorrow. And am I a tailor? Surely my head will roll in the morning." "Eh, brother, the morning is wiser than the evening; let us go and revel." 
 They went to the alehouse and drank and reveled. Again the shoemaker got tipsy, dragged home a whole keg of wine, and said to Prince Ivan: "Well, little fellow, tomorrow when you wake me up I will swallow three gallons; let them cut off my head while I am drunk. Such a gown I could not make in a lifetime." The master lay down to sleep and soon was snoring. But Prince Ivan blew his reed pipe and Lame and One-eyed appeared. "What do you wish, prince?" they asked. "Let a gown be ready for tomorrow-exactly like the one Elena the Fair wore in Whirlwind's castle." "It will be ready." 
 
 At daybreak Prince Ivan awoke and the gown was lying on the table, gleaming like fire, illumining the whole room. He roused his master, who opened his sleepy eyes and said: "What is it? Have I been sent for to have my head cut off? The wine, quickly!" "But the gown is ready." "Impossible! When did we have time to sew it?" "In the night, of course; you yourself cut it." "Ah, brother, I can hardly remember it; I see it as though in a dream." The shoemaker took the gown and ran to the palace. Elena the Fair gave him much money and said: "Now see to it that by tomorrow at daybreak, seven versts out at sea, a golden palace stands, and that from it a golden bridge leads to our palace, and that the bridge is spread with precious velvet, and that at the railings on both sides marvelous trees are growing and singing birds singing in various voices. If you have not done all this by tomorrow, I shall order you to be quartered." 
 The shoemaker left Elena the Fair and his head hung low. His friends met him. "Well, brother?" they asked. "I am lost! Tomorrow I shall be quartered. She gave me such a task that no devil could do it." "Oh, stop worrying! The morning is wiser than the evening; let us go to the alehouse." "Yes, let us go; I should at least have a good time before I die." So they drank and drank; by night the shoemaker had drunk so much that he had to be led home. "Farewell, little fellow," he said to Prince Ivan, "tomorrow I shall be put to death." "Is there a new task to perform?" "Yes." And he told his journeyman what it was. Then the shoemaker lay down and began to snore. Prince Ivan went straight to his room, blew his reed pipe, and Lame and One-eyed appeared. "What do you wish, Prince Ivan?" they asked. "You must do this and this for me." "Yes, Prince Ivan, here at last is a real task! Well, what must be done must be done. Tomorrow everything will be ready." 
 Next morning at daybreak Prince Ivan woke up and looked out of the window. Heavens above! Everything was ready; the golden castle was gleaming like fire. He roused his master, who jumped up in haste. "What is it?" he said. "Have they come for me? Quick, some wine! Let me be drunk when they put me to death." "But the palace is ready." "What are you 
 
 
 
 saying?" The shoemaker looked out of the window and gasped in amazement. "How was it done?" "Don't you remember how we toiled together?" "Ah, I must have slept soundly; I can hardly remember." They ran to the golden palace and found in it wealth undreamed, unheard of. Prince Ivan said: "Here is a broom for you, master. Go and dust the railings of the bridge. And when anyone comes and asks you who lives in the palace, do not say anything, but give him this little note." 
 The shoemaker went to dust the railings of the bridge. In the morning Elena the Fair woke up, saw the golden palace, and ran straightway to the king. "Look, Your Majesty!" she said. "See what is happening here! a golden palace has been built on the sea. From the palace a bridge seven versts long reaches to here. Around the bridge there are marvelous trees, and songbirds are singing in many voices." The king at once sent men out to ask what all this meant, and whether there was not some mighty hero come to his kingdom. The messengers came to the shoemaker and began to question him. He said: 
 
 "I do not know the answer, but I have a letter for your king." In this letter Prince Ivan told his father everything that had happened: how he had rescued his mother and won Elena the Fair, and how his older brothers had deceived him. With the messengers Prince Ivan sent golden carriages and asked the king and the queen, Elena the Fair, and her sisters to come to him; and he asked that his brothers be brought behind them in simple carts. 
 All of them made ready at once and set out; Prince Ivan met them with joy. The king wanted to put his elder sons to death for their perfidy, but Prince Ivan obtained pardon for them from his father. Then a grand feast began: Prince Ivan married Elena the Fair, the queen of the silver kingdom married Prince Piotr, and the queen of the copper kingdom married Prince Vasily. The shoemaker was made a general. I was at that feast and drank mead and wine; it ran down my mustache but did not go into my mouth.
