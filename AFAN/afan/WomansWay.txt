 MY dear husband, where are you going?" "I won't tell you." "Please, my dear, where are you going?" "To town, to the fair." "My darling, take me along." "I won't." "Please, my darling, take me along." "Sit at the very edge of the cart." "What do you have in the cart, my dear?" "I won't tell." "What, my dear, is in the cart?" "Apples." "Give me an apple, my dear." "I won't give you one." "Please, my dear, give me an apple." "Take one." "Where, my dear, shall we spend the night?" "I won't tell you." "Please tell me, my dear, where shall we spend the night?" "In the big village, in the priest's hay barn."
