 A certain old man had a foolish eon. The fool asked his father to find him a wife. "And if you don't find me a wife," he said, "I will smash up the stove." "But how can I find you a wife?" the father said. "I have no money." "You have no money, but we have an ox; sell him to be slaugh- 
 
 tered." The ox heard this and ran away to the woods. The fool kept urging his father without respite: "Find me a wife, find me a wife!" "But I have no money, I tell you." "You have no money, but we have a cock; slay him, bake a pie, and sell it." The cock heard this and flew away to the woods. The fool again urged his father: "Find me a wife or I will smash up the stove." The father said: "I would gladly find you a wife, but I have no money." "You have no money, but you have a sheep; sell it to be slaughtered." The sheep heard this and ran away to the woods. The ox, the sheep, and the cock joined company and built themselves a hut in the woods. The bear learned about it, wanted to eat them, and came to the hut. The cock saw him and began to flutter above the roost, flapping his wings and crowing: "Where, where, where? Give him to me here! I will trample him with my feet, cut him with an ax. A knife is right here, and a nail is right there; we'll slaughter him here, and hang him up there." The bear took fright and took to his heels; he ran and ran till he dropped from fright and died. The fool went to the woods, found the bear, removed his skin, and sold it, and with that money got him a wife. Then the ox, the sheep, and the cock came back home.
