 There WAS once a woodpecker who built her nest in an oak tree, laid three eggs, and hatched three young. A fox took to visiting their tree; she rapped the mossy oak with her long tail and said: "Woodpecker, climb down the oak! I need oak wood for my tools." "Eh, little fox," answered the woodpecker, "you wouldn't let me hatch even one little child!" "Eh, woodpecker, throw him down, I will teach him the blacksmith's trade." The woodpecker threw down one young one, and the fox ran from bush to bush, from tree to tree, and ate up the young woodpecker. 
 Again she went to the woodpecker and rapped the mossy oak with her long tail and said: "Woodpecker, climb down the oak, I need oak wood for my tools!" "Eh, little fox," answered the woodpecker, "you wouldn't let me hatch even one little child!" "Eh, woodpecker, throw him down, I will teach him the cobbler's trade." The woodpecker threw down another young one, and the fox ran from bush to bush, from tree to tree, and ate up the young woodpecker. 
 Again she went to the woodpecker and rapped the mossy oak with her long tail and said: "Woodpecker, climb down the oak. I need oak wood for my tools!" "Eh, little fox," answered the woodpecker, "you wouldn't let me hatch even one little child!" "Eh, woodpecker, throw him down, I will teach him the tailor's trade." The woodpecker threw down the last young one, and the fox ran from bush to bush, from tree to tree, and ate up the last young woodpecker.
