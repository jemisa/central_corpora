 A pig was on his way to Piter* to pray to God. He met a wolf. "Pig, pig, where are you going?" "To Piter, to pray to God." "Take me with you." "Come along, neighbor." They walked and walked and met a fox. "Pig, pig, where are you going?" "To Piter, to pray to God." "Take me with you too." "Come along, neighbor." They walked and met a hare. "Pig, pig, where are you going?" "To Piter, to pray to God." "Take me with you." "Come along, Slant Eyes!" Then a squirrel joined them and they walked and walked. At last they came to a ditch in the road, a ditch wide and deep. The pig jumped, and fell into the ditch, and after her the wolf, the fox, the hare, and the squirrel all fell in; they sat there for a long time and were very hungry, but there was nothing to eat. 
 Then the fox thought up a plan. "Let us," she said, "try out our own voices; whichever of us sings in the thinnest voice, him we shall eat." The wolf began in a rough voice: "O-o-o!" The pig sang in a slightly softer voice: "U-u-u!" The fox sang still more softly: "E-e-e!" And the hare and the squirrel piped in a thin voice: "I-i-i!" The bigger beasts at once tore the hare and the squirrel to pieces and gobbled them down to the last bone. The next day the fox said again: "Whoever sings in the roughest voice, him we shall eat." The wolf sang in the roughest voice-"O-o-o!"-and was eaten up. The fox ate the flesh but hid the entrails under herself. After about three days she began to eat the entrails. The pig asked her: "What are you eating, neighbor? Give me some." "Eh, pig, I am pulling out my own bowels; tear your belly open too, pull out your bowels, and eat of them." The pig did this; he tore his belly open and the fox had him for dinner. So the fox remained all alone in the ditch, and whether she finally climbed out or is still there, I really cannot say.
