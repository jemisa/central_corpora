 A HEN and A COCK lived together. One day they went to the woods for nuts. They came to a hazel tree; the cock climbed up the tree to pick nuts, and the hen remained on the ground to gather them up for the winter. Then the cock threw a nut that hit the hen's eye and knocked it out. The hen went away crying. Some boyars drove by and asked: "Little hen, little hen, why are you crying?" "The cock knocked out my eye." "Little cock, little cock, why did you knock out the hen's eye?" "The hazel tree tore my trousers." "Hazel tree, hazel tree, why did you tear the cock's trousers?" "Because the goats ate my bark." "Goats, goats, why did you eat the hazel tree's bark?" "Because the shepherds do not tend us." "Shepherds, shepherds, why don't you tend the goats?" "Because the peasant's wife does not give us pancakes." "Peasant's wife, peasant's wife, why don't you give the shepherds pancakes?" "Because my pig spilled my dough." "Pig, pig, why did you spill the dough?" "Because the wolf carried off my piglet." "Wolf, wolf, why did you carry off the piglet? "I was hungry and God told me to eat."
