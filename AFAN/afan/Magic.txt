 ONCE there lived an old man and an old woman who had a son. The old man was poor; he wanted to place the boy as an apprentice, that he might rejoice his parents in his youth, help them in their old age, and pray for their souls after their death. But what could he do, having no wealth? He led his son through many cities, hoping that someone would take him as an apprentice; but no, no one wanted to take him without being paid for it. The old man returned home, wept and wept with his wife, grieved over his poverty, and again led his son to the city. 
 They had no sooner come to the city than a man met them and asked: "Why are you so sad, old man?" "How can I help being sad?" said the old man. "I have been leading my son for many months, but no one wants to teach him a trade without being paid for it, and I have no money." "Give him to me," said the man. "In three years I will teach him all kinds of crafts. And in three years, on the same day, at the same hour as now, come for your son. But mind you: if you are not late, if you come on time and recognize your son, you can have him back. If you do not, he will have to remain with me." The old man was so overjoyed that he did not ask who the man was, where he lived, or what he would teach his son. He left his son with him and went home. He returned joyfully and told his wife all that had happened. But the man he had met was a magician. 
 Three years went by; the old man had completely forgotten on what day he had placed his son as an apprentice and did not know what to do. But one day before the term was up the son came flying to him in the shape of a little bird, struck the mound of earth near the house, and entered as a goodly youth. He bowed to his father and said that on the following day the old man would have to come for him because the term of three years would then be up; and he told his father where to come and how to recognize him. "I am not my master's only apprentice," he said. "There are eleven others who have remained with him forever because their parents could not recognize them; and if you fail to recognize me, I shall be the twelfth to remain with him forever. Tomorrow, when you come for me, our master will set all twelve of us free in the shape of white doves, all alike, feather for feather, tail for tail and head for head. But do you look carefully: all of them will soar high, but I will fly slightly higher than the others. The master will ask: 'Do you recognize your son?' Then do you point at the dove that flies highest. Then he will lead twelve colts before you- all of the same color, all with their manes on the same side, and all alike. When you pass by these colts, watch carefully: I will stamp my right foot. The master will ask again: 'Do you recognize your son?' And do you point boldly at me. Then he will lead twelve good youths before you, all alike, body for body, hair for hair, voice for voice, all the same in face and in dress. When you pass by these youths, watch carefully:- a little fly will sit on my right cheek. The master will ask you again: 'Do you recognize your son?' And do you point at me." He said all this, took leave of his father, and went forth from the house, struck the mound of earth, turned into a bird, and flew to his master. Next morning the old man arose, made ready, and went for his son. He came to the magician. "Well, old man," said the magician, "I have taught all kinds of crafts 
 
 to your son. But if you do not recognize him, he must stay with me for all eternity." Then he set free twelve white doves, all alike, feather for feather, tail for tail, head for head, and said: "Now find your son, old man!" How could he recognize his son, since the birds were all alike? He looked and looked, and when one dove soared higher than the others, he pointed at it, saying: 
 
 
 "I think this one is mine." "You have recognized him, old man," said the magician. 
 Next he led out twelve colts, all alike, with their manes on one side. The old man began to walk around the colts and to look, and the master asked him: "Well, grandfather, have you recognized your son?" "Not yet-wait a while," said the old man. But when he saw one colt stamping its right foot, he straightway pointed at it, saying: "I think this one is mine." "You have recognized him, old man." Finally, twelve good youths came forth, all alike, body for body, hair for hair, voice for voice, with faces all alike, as though they had been borne by one mother. The old man passed by the youths once and did not notice anything; he passed by a second time and still did not notice anything. But the third time he saw a fly sitting on the right cheek of one youth and said: "I think this one is mine." "You have recognized him, old man," said the master. The magician had no choice now; he gave the old man his son, and they went home together. 
 
 They walked and walked and saw a nobleman driving on the road. "Father," said the son, "I shall now turn into a dog. The nobleman will want to buy me; sell me, but do not sell my collar, for then I will not return to you." Having said this, he struck the earth and turned into a dog. The nobleman saw that the old man was leading a dog and began to bargain for it; he did not like the dog so much as he liked the collar. The nobleman offered a hundred rubles, the old man asked three hundred; they bargained and bargained, and in the end the nobleman bought the dog for two hundred rubles. When the old man began to remove the collar from the dog, the nobleman protested loudly; he insisted on having it. "I did not sell the collar," said the old man, "I sold only the dog." But the nobleman replied: "No, you are lying! He who bought the dog, bought him with his collar." The old man thought and thought that after all one cannot buy a dog without a collar, and gave it to the new owner. The nobleman put the dog in his carriage and the old man took the money and went home. 
 The nobleman drove and drove, when all of a sudden a hare ran across the road. "I will set the dog on the hare and see him run," thought the nobleman. He let the dog go and watched; the hare ran off on one side, the dog on the other, and both vanished into the woods. The nobleman waited and waited for the dog, then lost patience and went home with nothing, and the dog turned into a good youth. Meanwhile the old man walked and walked along the broad road thinking to himself: "How can I show myself at home, how can I tell my wife what I have done with my son?" Then his son overtook him. "Eh, father," he said, "why did you sell me with my collar? If we had not happened to meet a hare, I should never have returned, I should have been lost for nothing!" 
 They returned home and lived fairly comfortably. After a long time or a short time, the son said one Sunday to his father: "Father, I will turn into a bird. Do you take me to market and sell me; only do not sell my cage, for then I shall not return home." He struck the earth and turned into a bird; the old man put him in a cage and carried it to market. People thronged around the old man, vying with each other to buy the 
 
 bird, so greatly did he charm their souls. The magician also came, recognized the old man at once, and guessed what kind of bird was in his cage. One man offered a high price, another a still higher price, but the magician offered most of all. The old man sold him the bird but refused to give him the cage; the magician argued with him and insisted, but all to no avail. The buyer took the bird without the cage, wrapped it in a handkerchief, and took it home. "Well, little daughter," he said at home, "I have bought our rascal." "Where is he?" The magician opened his handkerchief, but the bird was gone-it had flown away. 
 Another Sunday came. The son said to his father: "Father, now I will turn into a horse. Mind you, sell the horse, but not the bridle; else I shall not return home." He struck the damp earth and turned into a horse; the old man led it to market. Horse dealers thronged around the old man; some offered a high price, others a still higher price, but the magician offered most of all. The old man sold him the horse but refused to give him the bridle. "How shall I lead the horse?" said the magician. "Let me bring him to my yard at least, and then you can have your bridle; I won't need it." All the horse dealers began to remonstrate with the old man, saying that this was the custom-that if he sold the horse, he also had to sell the bridle. What could he do? He gave away the bridle. 
 The magician brought the horse to his courtyard, put it in a stable, tethered it firmly to a ring, and stretched its head up high. The horse stood only on its hind legs; its forelegs did not touch the ground. "Well, daughter," the magician said again, "this time I have bought our rascal." "Where is he?" "In the stable." The daughter ran to see him; she took pity on the goodly youth, she wanted to loosen the reins, and began to disentangle and untie them. The horse wrested himself free and ran away. The daughter rushed to her father. "Father," she said, "forgive me! An evil thought confused me, the horse ran away." 
 The magician struck the damp earth, turned into a gray wolf, and ran in pursuit; he was close behind the horse now-at any moment he would overtake him. The horse came to a river, 
 
 struck the ground, turned into a perch, and-plop!-into the water he jumped. But the wolf plunged after him in the shape of a pike. The perch swam and swam, came near to a jetty where lovely maidens were washing linen, turned into a golden ring, and rolled to the feet of a merchant's daughter. The merchant's daughter picked up the ring and hid it. The magician again turned into a man and said to her: "Give me back my golden ring." "Take it!" said the maiden and threw the ring on the ground. When it struck the ground, it shattered into tiny seeds of grain. The magician turned into a cock and rushed to peck the grain; while he pecked it, one seed of grain turned into a hawk. And that was too bad for the cock: the hawk tore him to pieces! 
 This is the end of my tale, and now I would not mind having a glass of vodka.
