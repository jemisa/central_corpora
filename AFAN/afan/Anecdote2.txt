 A young peasant went hunting and his wife walked with him part of the way; after having walked for a verst she began to cry. "Don't cry, wife, I'll soon be back," the peasant said. "But that's not why I'm crying," the wife said. "I'm crying because my feet are ice cold." 
 Once a fool was soundly thrashed during the night and the next morning everyone made fun of him. "You should thank God," he said, "that the night was clear; otherwise I would have played a trick on you." "What trick? Tell us!" "I would have hidden myself."
