 ON A CERTAIN BIG estate there was a German steward who did not observe the holidays of the Russian folk and forced the peasants to work all the time. One day the village elder came to him and said: "Tomorrow we have a holiday; work is forbidden." "What holiday have you thought up now?" "St. Nicholas' day, little father." "And who is he? Show him to me." The elder brought him an icon. "Oh, that is just a wooden board," said the German. "It can't do anything to me; I shall work, and so will you." So the peasants decided to play a trick on the German. Again the elder came to see him, saying: "Little father, tomorrow we have a holiday." "What holiday?" "St. Hornet's day." "Who is he? Show him to me." The elder brought him to a hollow tree, in which the hornets had a nest. "There he is," he said to the steward. The German began to peep in through the cracks and heard the hornets humming and humming. "How he sings!" said the German. "He must have drunk some vodka! Well, I am not afraid of him, and will order you to work in any case." As the German spoke, the hornets flew out and fell to stinging him. "Ai, ai!" he cried at the top of his lungs. "I swear I won't order you to work, and I won't work myself-I'll even let the peasants take a whole week's holiday!"
