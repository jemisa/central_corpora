 A WOMAN came TO AN INN and asked about her husband: "Was not my drunkard here?" "He was." "Ah, the scoundrel, the knave! How much did he drink?" "Five kopeks' worth." "Well, give me ten kopeks' worth!" 
 Once a turnip said: "I taste very good with honey." "Go along, you boaster," replied the honey, "I taste good without you."
