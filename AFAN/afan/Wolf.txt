 An old man and his old wife had five sheep, a colt, and a calf. A wolf came to them and began to sing: 
 There once was a farmer Who had five sheep, A colt, and a calf- Seven beasts in all! 
 The old woman said to the old man: "Oh, what a fine song! Give him a sheep!" The old man gave him a sheep. The wolf ate it and came again, singing the same song; and he came singing it until he had eaten the sheep, the colt, the calf, and the old woman. The old man remained alone; again the wolf came to him with the same song. The old man took a poker and began to belabor the wolf. The wolf ran away and never again came near the old man; and the old man remained alone in his wretchedness.
