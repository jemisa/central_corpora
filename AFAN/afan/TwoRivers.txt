 For A long time the Volga River and the Vazuza River disputed as to which of them was the cleverer, stronger, and deserving of the greater honors. They argued and argued and neither would give in to the other. Finally they decided to settle the matter in this way. "Let us lie down to sleep," they said, "and whichever of us wakes up and reaches the Khvalinsky Sea first will be considered the cleverer, stronger, and deserving of the greater honors." 
 The Volga lay down to sleep and so did the Vazuza. In the middle of the night the Vazuza rose quietly, ran away from the Volga, chose a short, straight road to the sea, and started flowing. The Volga, upon awakening, flowed neither too slowly nor too fast, but just as a river should flow. At Zubtsov she overtook the Vazuza with such force that the Vazuza was frightened by her younger sister, and begged her, the Volga, to take her, the Vazuza, in her arms and carry her to the sea. Nevertheless, it is still the Vazuza that wakes first in the spring and rouses the Volga from her long winter sleep.
