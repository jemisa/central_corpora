 A fox and A lobster were standing together and talking. The fox said to the lobster: "Let's have a race!" The l lobster said: "Why not? Let's!" They began to race. As soon as the fox started, the lobster hung on to his tail. The fox ran to the goal and still the lobster did not detach himself. The fox turned around to see where the lobster was. He shook his tail and the lobster detached himself and said: "I have been waiting here for a long time."
