 ONCE THERE LIVED a king and a queen; they had a son and a daughter, called Ivanushka and Alionushka. When their parents died the children remained alone and went wandering in the wide world. They walked and walked and walked till they saw a pond, and near the pond a herd of cows was grazing. "I am thirsty," said Ivanushka. "I want to drink." "Do not drink, little brother, or you will become a calf," said Alionushka. The brother heeded her and they went on farther; they walked and walked and saw a river, and near it a drove of horses. "Ah, little sister," Ivanushka said, "if you 
 
 only knew how thirsty I am!" "Do not drink, little brother, or you will become a colt." Ivanushka heeded her, and they went on farther; they walked and walked and saw a lake, and near it a flock of sheep. "Ah, little sister, I am terribly thirsty," Ivanushka said. "Do not drink, little brother, or you will become a sheep." Ivanushka heeded her and they went on farther; they walked and walked and saw a stream, and near it pigs were feeding. "Ah, little sister, I must drink," Ivanushka said. "I am frightfully thirsty." "Do not drink, little brother, or you will become a piglet." Ivanushka heeded her again and they went on farther; they walked and walked and saw a flock of goats grazing near a well. "Ah, little sister, now I must drink," Ivanushka said. "Do not drink, little brother, or you will become a kid." But he could not restrain himself and did not heed his sister; he drank from the well, and became a kid. He leaped before Alionushka and cried: "Maa-ka-ka! maa-ka-ka!" 
 Alionushka tied him with a silken belt and led him on, shedding tears, bitter tears. The kid ran and ran till he ran into the garden of a certain king. The servants saw him and at once reported to the king. "Your Majesty," they said, "in our garden there is a kid; a maiden is leading him on a belt, and she is a great beauty." The king ordered them to find out who she was. The servants asked her whence she came and of what parentage she was. "There were a king and a queen and they died," said Alionushka. "We children remained-I, the princess, and my little brother, the prince. He could not restrain himself, drank water from a well, and became a kid." The servants reported all this to the king. He called Alionushka before him and questioned her about everything; she pleased him and he wanted to marry her. Soon they celebrated their wedding and began to live together, and the kid lived with them; he walked in the garden and ate and drank with the king and queen. 
 One day the king went hunting. While he was away a sorceress came and cast a spell on the queen; Alionushka fell ill and became thin and pale. Everything became gloomy at the king's palace; the flowers in the garden began to fade, the trees to dry, and the grass to wither. The king returned and asked the 
 
 queen: "Are you sick?" "Yes, I am sick," answered the queen. Next day the king again went hunting. Alionushka lay ill; the sorceress came to her and said: "Do you want me to heal you? Go to such and such a sea at twilight and drink water there." The queen heeded her and at twilight went to that sea. The sorceress was waiting for her, seized her, tied a stone around her neck, and cast her into the sea. Alionushka sank to the bottom; the kid ran to the shore and wept bitterly. But the sorceress turned herself into the likeness of the queen and went back to the palace. 
 The king came home and was overjoyed to find that the queen was well again. They set the table and began to dine. "But where is the kid?" asked the king. "We don't want him with us," said the sorceress. "I gave orders that he be shut out; he has a goatlike smell." Next day, as soon as the king went hunting, the sorceress beat and beat the kid and threatened: "When the king returns I will ask him to slaughter you." The king returned and the sorceress begged him over and over again to have the kid slaughtered. "I am annoyed with him, I am tired of him," she said. The king pitied the kid, but there was nothing to be done; the queen insisted and urged him so much that in the end he consented and gave leave to have the kid slaughtered. The kid saw that steel knives were being sharpened for him, and he wept. He ran to the king and implored him: "King, give me leave to go to the sea, to drink water, to rinse my insides." The king let him go. The kid ran to the sea, stood on the shore, and cried plaintively: 
 Alionushka, my little sister, 
 Come up, come up to the shore. 
 Hot fires are burning, 
 Big kettles are boiling, 
 Steel knives are being sharpened- 
 They want to slaughter me! 
 She answered him: 
 Ivanushka, my little brother, 
 The heavy stone is pulling me down, 
 The cruel serpent has sucked out my heart. 
 
 The kid wept and returned home. In the middle of the day he again asked the king: "King, give me leave to go to the sea, to drink water and rinse my insides." The king allowed him to go. The kid ran to the sea and cried plaintively: 
 Alionushka, my little sister, 
 Come up, come up to the shore. 
 Hot fires are burning, 
 Big kettles are boiling, 
 Steel knives are being sharpened- 
 They want to slaughter me! 
 She answered him: 
 Ivanushka, my little brother, 
 The heavy stone is pulling me down, 
 The cruel serpent has sucked out my heart. 
 The kid wept and returned home. The king wondered why the kid kept running to the sea. Now the kid asked him for the third time: "King, give me leave to go to the sea, to drink water and rinse my insides." The king let him go and followed him. When he came to the sea he heard the kid calling to his sister: 
 Alionushka, my little sister, 
 Come up, come up to the shore. 
 Hot fires are burning, 
 Big kettles are boiling, 
 Steel knives are being sharpened- 
 They want to slaughter me! 
 She answered him: 
 Ivanushka, my little brother, 
 The heavy stone is pulling me down, 
 The cruel serpent has sucked out my heart. 
 The kid again called to his sister. Alionushka swam up and came to the surface. The king snatched her, tore the stone from her neck, pulled her ashore, and asked her how all this had happened. She told him everything. The king was overjoyed and so also was the kid; he capered, and everything in the gar- 
 
 den grew green and blossomed again. The king ordered the sorceress to be put to death; a stake of wood was set up in the courtyard and she was burned. After that the king, the queen, and the kid began to live happily and to prosper and to eat and drink together as before. 
 THE SEVEN SEMYONS 
 A wealthy old peasant had neither son nor daughter; he began to pray to God that he send him at least one child to rejoice him in his lifetime and succeed him after his death. One day seven sons were born to him and they were all called Semyon. God did not grant it to them to grow up under the care of their father and mother; the Semyons were left orphans. Now, it is well known what an orphan's life is: although he is little and has not yet a man's wisdom, he will follow every trail, try every task. And so it was with the Semyons. When harvest time came, people busied themselves, they mowed and reaped and brought grain to the threshing barn, and then the earth had to be plowed up and winter grain had to be sown. The Semyons thought and thought, and although they had no strength, they went with the people to the wide fields and dug there like worms. The tsar drove by and was surprised to see little children working beyond their strength. He called them to him, began to question them, and learned that they had neither father nor mother. "I will be your father," said the tsar. "Tell me, what trade you wish to practice?" The eldest Semyon answered: "Sire, I will be a smith and I will forge a pillar such as no tongue can tell of nor pen describe. It will almost reach the sky." 
 "And I," answered the second Semyon, "will climb that pillar and look around in all directions, and tell you what is going on in foreign lands and kingdoms." The tsar praised him. The third Semyon answered: "I will be a shipwright and 
 
 
 
 make a ship." "Good!" The fourth said: "I will steer the ship and be her helmsman." "Good." The fifth said: "And I, if need be, will take the ship by its prow and hide it on the bottom of the sea." The sixth said: "And if need be, I will bring it back from the bottom of the sea." "All of you want to be useful people," said the tsar. "But you," he went on, turning to the youngest, "what trade do you want to learn?" "Sire, I will be a thief." "Oh, that is an evil project! I need no thieves, I will put a thief to death." The sovereign said farewell to the children and left, having bound the Semyons as apprentices. After a long time they grew up and learned the trades they had chosen; the sovereign summoned them to him to try their skill, test their art, and examine their learning. 
 The blacksmith forged such a pillar that if you threw your head back to look at its top your neck hurt, for it almost reached the sky. The tsar praised him. The second brother climbed to the top of the pillar as quickly as a squirrel and looked in all directions; all the lands and kingdoms were open before him, and he began to tell what was happening in them. "And in such and such a land, in such and such a kingdom," he said, "there lives Princess Elena the Fair, of such a beauty as has never before been seen: blood red color spreads on her face, white down spreads on her breast, and one can see how her marrow flows from bone to bone." The tsar liked that best of all. The third brother hammered-bing bang!-and built a ship as beautiful as a house. The tsar was overjoyed. The fourth brother began to steer the ship; the ship ran on the sea like a live fish. The tsar was highly pleased. The fifth seized the ship in full flight, pulled it by the prow, and it went to the bottom of the sea. In one minute the sixth brother pulled it back from the bottom of the sea, like a light boat, and the ship was afloat again as though nothing had happened. The tsar liked this trick too. 
 But for the youngest brother, the thief, a gallows was erected and a noose was made. The tsar asked him: "Are you as skilled in your trade as your brothers are in theirs?" "I am even more skillful than they." He was about to be strung up on the gallows 
 
 when he cried: "Wait, Your Majesty! Perhaps I will be useful to you. Order me to steal Elena the Fair for you; but let my brothers come with me. I will sail with them in the new ship, and Princess Elena will be yours." The tsar could not get Elena the Fair out of his head, he had heard much good about her, and his heart yearned for her; but she lived far away, beyond the thrice ninth land, in the thrice tenth kingdom. The thief's project seemed good; although one could not rely on his courage, one could try him, thought the tsar. So he gave leave to the thief and his brothers to sail, and the new ship was laden with riches of every description. 
 Whether they sailed for a long time or a short time is not known, but they finally arrived in the kingdom where Princess Elena the Fair lived. It was not necessary to tell the thief what to say and how to go about his business. He found out everything. Having learned that there were no cats in that land, he dressed as a merchant and took a kitten with him; stroking and caressing it, he led it on a golden cord past the window of Elena the Fair. The princess saw the pretty little beast, liked it, and ordered it to be bought for her. The thief answered that he was a wealthy merchant, that he had come from the wealthiest kingdom, bringing all kinds of rarities and jewels, and that he wished to show his good will to Elena the Fair by giving her the kitten as a gift. The thief was invited to the palace; the cat performed various tricks and the princess admired them. The thief spoke so much about his extraordinary rarities, brought and spread before her such marvelous cloths, such magnificent finery, that she could not take her eyes away from them. 
 "But this is nothing compared to what I still have," he said. "These things I can show to anyone, whoever wants can buy them. But you, princess, would you like to see a priceless treasure that no one has seen? It is aboard my ship under heavy guard and I will show it only to you. It replaces fire by night and the sun by day, and illumines every dark spot with a marvelous light. It is a stone of extraordinary beauty; and I cannot take it out-to show it would be to doom myself, for everyone would want to possess it. I paid a high price to get it; 
 
 but even dearer to me is the favor of my tsar, to whom I am bringing this marvel as a gift." The princess promised to visit the ship and look at the treasure. 
 Next day, accompanied by nurses, governesses, and maids-in-waiting, she went from the palace to the ship. All her retinue remained on shore; only Elena was to be allowed to see the marvelous light of the incomparable stone. Everything had been prepared for her reception; the other Semyons were there to help, and as soon as she was aboard ship, the fifth brother seized the ship by the prow and brought it down to the bottom of the sea. The water seethed and swirled, and then the waves rolled as before, as though nothing had happened; only on shore the nurses and governesses and maids-in-waiting wailed and wept, and the king, Elena's father, sent men in pursuit of the princess. But they all returned empty-handed. Elena the Fair sailed far on the blue sea. The sixth brother brought the ship back to the surface; it sailed like a swan rolling on the waves, and soon came to the shores of the Semyons' native land. The tsar was overjoyed; he had not even dreamed of ever receiving Elena the Fair in his own house. He generously rewarded the Semyons, exempted them from land rent and head taxes; and he married Elena the Fair and gave a feast for all to enjoy. 
 I walked a thousand versts only to be there. I drank beer and mead; it ran down my mustache but did not go into my mouth. I was given a horse made of ice, a saddle of turnip, and a bridle of peas; a flowing robe was put on my back and an embroidered cap on my head. I went forth in all this attire and stopped to rest; I removed the saddle and the bridle, tied the horse to a tree, and lay down on the grass. Suddenly pigs came and ate the saddle of turnip; chickens came and pecked the bridle of peas; the sun rose and melted the horse of ice. Grieved, I continued on foot. As I walked along the road, a magpie jumped to my side and cawed: "Flowing robe, flowing robe!" I fancied that she said, "Throw the robe," so I removed it and threw it away. "And do I need the embroidered cap?" I thought. I snatched it off and threw it down, and, as you can see, was left with nothing at all.
