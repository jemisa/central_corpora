 A sheep ran away from a certain peasant's flock. She hap- 
 pened to meet a fox, who asked her: "Where is God 
 taking you, friend?" "Oh, oh, my friend, I was in a 
 peasant's flock, but my life was very hard; whenever the ram 
 did some mischief, I, the sheep, was held responsible. So I made up my mind to go away, I know not whither." "It's the same thing with me," answered the fox. "Whenever my husband caught a chicken, I, the vixen, was always held responsible. Let us run together." After some time they met a wolf. "Good day, friends," he said. "Good day," said the fox. "Are you going far?" he asked. "I don't know where I'm going," the fox said and told him her troubles. The wolf said: "It is the same with me: whenever the she-wolf slaughtered a lamb, I, the wolf, was held responsible. Let us go together." 
 They went. On the way the wolf said to the sheep: "Hey, sheep, you are wearing my coat!" The fox heard him and said: "Is it really yours, friend?" "Certainly." "Will you swear to it?" "I will." "Will you take a solemn oath?" "I will." At this point the fox saw that some peasants had set a trap near the road. She brought the wolf to the edge of the trap and said: "Now, go in there to take your solemn oath." The wolf foolishly went into the trap, which snapped and caught his snout. The fox and the sheep at once ran away from him for good.
