 There was once an old miser who had two sons and a great deal of money. When he heard Death coming, he locked himself up in his room, sat on his oaken chest, swallowed his gold coins, chewed up his bills, and thus ended his life. His sons came, laid out the dead body under the holy icons, and invited the sexton to chant the psalms. At midnight a devil in human form suddenly appeared, took the old man on his shoulders, and said: "Hold up the flap of your coat, sexton!" And he shook the dead man, saying: "The money is yours, but the bag is mine." And he vanished, taking the body with him.
