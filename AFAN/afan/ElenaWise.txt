 IN OLDEN TIMES in a certain kingdom, not in our land, a soldier chanced to be on guard at a stone tower; the tower was locked and sealed, and it was night. On the stroke of midnight the soldier thought he heard someone in the tower saying: "Eh, soldier!" He asked: "Who calls me?" "It is I, an evil spirit," said a voice from behind the iron bars. "I have sat here for thirty years without food or drink." "What do you want?" "Let me out of here; whenever you are in need, I will help you; just remember me, and at that very moment I shall come to your aid." The soldier straightway tore off the seal, broke the lock, and opened the door, and the evil spirit flew out of the tower, soared upward, and vanished more quickly than lightning. "Well," thought the soldier, "a fine thing I have done! All my years of service are not worth a penny now. I will be put in the guardhouse, court-martialed, and perhaps made to run the gantlet; I'd better run away while there is still time." He threw his gun and knapsack on the ground and walked away straight ahead. 
 He walked one day, a second day, and a third day; hunger tormented him, yet he had nothing to eat or drink. He sat on the road, wept bitter tears, and began to think: "Well, am I not a fool? I served the king for ten years, I was always sated and content; every day I received three pounds of bread. But I had to run away to die of hunger! Eh, evil spirit, it is all your fault!" Suddenly out of nowhere the evil spirit appeared before him and said: "Good day, soldier! Why are you so sad?" "How can I help being sad when I have been tormented by hunger for three days?" "Do not grieve, this can be remedied," said the evil spirit. He rushed here and there, brought all kinds of wine and provisions, fed the soldier, and invited him to his house. "In my house you will have an easy life," the evil spirit said. "You can eat, drink, and be merry as much as your heart desires. Only look after my daughters, I don't demand anything else." The soldier consented and the evil spirit seized him by 
 
 the arm, raised him high, very high in the air, and carried him beyond thrice nine lands, to the thrice tenth kingdom, to a white stone palace. 
 The evil spirit had three daughters, who were beauties. He ordered them to obey the soldier and to give him food and drink in abundance, and himself flew away to do mischief, as is the custom of evil spirits. He never sat in one place, but kept traveling about the world, troubling people and tempting them to sin. The soldier stayed with the lovely maidens and began to have such a gay life that he did not think of dying. Only one thing worried him: every night the lovely maidens left the house and where they went he did not know. He tried to question them, but they refused to answer, denying everything. "Very well, then," he thought, "I will stand guard for a whole night and I will find out where you go." At night he lay on his bed, pretended that he was sound asleep, and waited impatiently. 
 When the time came, he stole qtiietly up to the maidens' bedroom, stood at the door, bent down, and looked through the keyhole. The lovely maidens brought in a magic carpet, spread it on the floor, struck the carpet, and turned into doves; they shook their wings and flew out of the window. "What a marvel!" thought the soldier. "I'll try it too." He jumped into the bedroom, struck the carpet, and turned into a hedge sparrow; he flew out of the window and followed the doves. They alighted on a green meadow, and the sparrow sat behind a currant bush, hiding among the leaves and peeping out from there. An immense host of doves gathered, covering the whole meadow; in the middle of the meadow stood a golden throne. After a short while, heaven and earth were illumined; a golden carriage flew in the air, drawn by six fiery dragons; in the carriage sat Princess Elena the Wise, a marvelous beauty such as no mind can imagine and no tongue can tell of. She descended from her carriage and sat on the golden throne; then she began to call each dove in turn and to teach it various cunning tricks. When she had finished teaching the doves she jumped into the carriage and drove off. 
 Then all the doves left the green meadow, flying each in a 
 
 different direction, and the hedge sparrow followed the three sisters and found itself together with the doves in the bedroom. The doves struck the carpet and turned into lovely maidens, and the hedge sparrow struck the carpet and turned into a soldier. "Whence do you come?" the maidens asked him. "I have been with you on the green meadow; I saw the beautiful princess on the golden throne and I heard her teach you various cunning tricks." "Well, you are lucky to have escaped! For this princess, Elena the Wise, is our powerful ruler. If she had had her magic book with her, she would have discovered your presence at once, and you would not have escaped a cruel death. Take care, soldier! Do not return to the green meadow, do not look at Elena the Wise, or you will lose your rash head." The soldier was not frightened; he let these words pass through his ears unheeded. He waited till the next night, struck the carpet, and turned into a hedge sparrow. The hedge sparrow flew to the green meadow, hid behind a currant bush, looked at Elena the Wise, feasted his eyes upon her marvelous beauty, and thought: "If I could get such a wife, I would want nothing else in the world! I will follow her and find out where she lives." 
 Elena the Wise came down from her golden throne, sat in her carriage, and soared in the air to her marvelous palace; the hedge sparrow flew after her. The princess came to her palace; her governesses and nurses ran out to meet her, seized her by the arms, and led her to her magnificent chambers. The hedge sparrow flew to the garden, chose a beautiful tree that stood right under the princess' bedroom, perched on a branch, and began to sing so well and so plaintively that the princess could not close her eyes all night. She listened and listened. As soon as the radiant sun arose, Elena the Wise cried in a loud voice: "Governesses and nurses, run to the garden, catch that hedge sparrow!" The governesses and nurses rushed to the garden and tried to catch the songbird, but the old women were not equal to this task. The hedge sparrow fluttered from bush to bush, never flying far, yet refusing to be caught. 
 The princess became impatient. She ran out into the green garden to catch the hedge sparrow herself; she came up to the 
 
 bush, and the bird did not move from the branch, but sat drooping its wings, as though waiting for her. The princess was overjoyed, took the bird in her hands, carried it to the palace, put it in a golden cage, and hung the cage in her bedroom. The day went by, the sun set. Elena the Wise flew to the green meadow, returned, undressed, and lay in her bed. The hedge sparrow gazed at her white body and her wondrous beauty and trembled all over. As soon as the princess had fallen asleep, the hedge sparrow turned into a fly, flew out of the golden cage, struck the floor, and turned into a goodly youth. The goodly youth came up to the princess' bed, gazed and gazed at her beauty, could not restrain himself, and kissed her on her sweet mouth. He saw that the princess was awakening, turned quickly into a fly, flew into the cage, and became a hedge sparrow. 
 Elena the Wise opened her eyes; she looked around her and saw no one. "Apparently," she thought, "I dreamed all that in a dream." She turned over and fell asleep again. But the soldier could not restrain himself; he tried a second and a third time, and the princess, who was a light sleeper, awoke after each kiss. After the third time she rose from her bed and said: "Something is wrong; I must look into my magic book." She looked into it and found at once that in the golden cage there was not a simple hedge sparrow but a young soldier. "Ah, you insolent fellow," she cried, "get out of that cage! For this deception you will answer with your life." 
 The hedge sparrow had no choice; it flew out of the golden cage, struck the floor, and turned into a goodly youth. The soldier fell on his knees before the princess and began to beg for her pardon. "There is no pardon for you, scoundrel," said Elena the Wise, and called the executioner to cut the soldier's head off. Out of nowhere a giant appeared with an ax and a block, threw the soldier down, pressed his head to the block, and raised his ax, waiting for the princess to give the signal with her handkerchief. "Have mercy upon me!" the soldier begged with tears in his eyes. "Give me leave to sing a song before I die." "Sing, but hurry!" said Elena. The soldier intoned a song so sad, so plaintive, that Elena the Wise began to 
 
 weep. She took pity on the goodly youth and said to him: "I give you ten hours; if by that time you manage to hide so cunningly that I can't find you, I shall marry you; if you do not, I shall order your head to be cut off." 
 The soldier went out of the palace, wandered into a thick forest, sat under a bush, and became sad and thoughtful. "Ah, evil spirit, it is all your fault!" he said. At that very moment the evil spirit appeared before him, saying: "What do you want, soldier?" "Eh," the soldier said, "my death is approaching! Where shall I hide from Elena the Wise?" The evil spirit struck the earth and turned into a blue-winged eagle. "Soldier, sit on my back," he said. "I will carry you to the skies." The soldier sat on the eagle, who soared upward and flew beyond black clouds. Five hours passed. Elena the Wise took her magic book, looked into it, and saw everything as though on the palm of her hand. She cried in a loud voice: "Enough, eagle! Stop flying in the skies. Descend! You will not hide from me." The eagle descended to the ground. 
 The soldier was even more grieved than before. "What shall I do now?" he asked. "Where shall I hide?" "Wait," said the evil spirit, "I will help you." He jumped to the soldier, struck him on his cheek, and turned him into a pin; then he himself turned into a mouse, seized the pin in his teeth, stole into the palace, found the magic book, and stuck the pin into it. The last five hours passed. Elena the Wise opened her magic book, looked and looked, and the book showed nothing; the princess grew very angry and flung the book into the stove. The pin fell out of the book, struck the floor, and turned into a goodly youth. Elena the Wise took his arm. "I am cunning," she said, "but you are more cunning than I." They did not stop to think too long; they wedded and began to live together happily.
